                         <p class="large-text">
                              This section is about breaking down the clinical data. I think the hardest part
                              of being a biotechnology investor is knowing how to read the clinical data, and how to figure out 
                              what it all means. There are a lot of technical endpoints that can confuse investors. Sometimes
                              companies fail to design a good clinical trial. This happens too often. Many of these young companies
                              are not experts in designing or running clinical trials. This section will be some teaching about 
                              the clinical trials and the data to look for, but a lot of it will be going through actual clinical 
                              data readouts by companies and breaking it down. I am not an expert in reading clinical data, but I 
                              have been doing it for many years. Most of the takes I give on clinical data will be just my point
                              of view. Other investors might not agree with my point of view on any data readouts. That is OK. There
                              is a lot to consider when looking at data to include data from competitors.

                         <p>     
                              First will be years of preclinical work. This is all about the chemistry, formulation, toxicology and 
                              manufacturing of the drug. They will have to do extensive testing and submit all that data to the FDA 
                              for the Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The first studies will be done in human cells. This 
                              will be to establish a proof of concept of how the biology works in the cells. Then they will move to 
                              animal models. This is often mice and Non Human Primates (NHP). Since the systems in animals are not 
                              always exactly the same as humans, not every drug will be tested in both mice and monkeys. Some concepts 
                              like immunology might not be applicable to one of these animals. Once all the animal models are done, 
                              the company will submit all its data for a IND with the FDA. The FDA will review the data and determine 
                              if human trials can proceed. Whenever the FDA finds and issue in any stage of clinical development, they will often issue a hold or 
                              partial hold on that program along with a Complete Response Letter (CRL). This letter will request more 
                              information on topics of concern. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Then the drug will proceed into phase 1 clinical trials. The sole purpose of this stage of development is 
                              to prove the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the drug. The PK goes by the acronym ADME for 
                              Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion. Phase 1 is all about learning how the drug works in 
                              the human body and any side effects it might cause. In non life threatening diseases, this is done in 
                              healthy volunteers. In diseases like cancer, they will test in patients with the disease. The first 2 
                              studies are the SAD (Single Ascending Dose) and MAD (Multiple Ascending Dose) studies. This is where 
                              they test multiple doses across groups of patients to see how each dose responds. You might hear of the 
                              phase 1a and phase1 b studies. The phase 1a is all about the dose escalation and safety. The phase 1b is about finding 
                              the right dose to move to phase 2. This might include expanding the patients tested at some doses that 
                              seem to have the best responses.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Then the drug moves to phase 2. This is all about testing the efficacy of the drug in patients with the 
                              disease. Sometimes you will hear about phase 2a and 2b. The phase 2a might be more dose testing in 
                              patients with the disease to see which ones respond best. Then they can expand to phase 2b where they 
                              focus on the dose where the best efficacy was seen. There can be many phase 2 trials for the same drug. 
                              Once safety has been established in phase 1, they can test the drug in many different diseases with 
                              phase 2 trials. This is where they will expand the trials into all indications where they think a good 
                              signal of response was seen. Some phase 2 programs will start with a basket trial. This is where they 
                              test the drug with patients from different diseases to see which diseases show a good response. Then 
                              they expand those indications into a complete phase 2 study to test the efficacy in that specific 
                              disease. The key to good phase 2 data is understanding exactly what that study drug contributes to 
                              the efficacy toward a disease. Often companies will design confusing trials with multiple drugs that 
                              mask the efficacy of any single drug.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              After a successful efficacy study in phase 2, the drug will proceed to phase 3. The phase 3 is designed 
                              to test this drug vs the current standard of care. The phase 3 is the hardest as it has to prove the 
                              drug actually improves outcomes for patients vs what they might be taking now. If the standard of care is
                              Chemo + PD1, then the study might be Study Drug + PD1 + Chemo vs PD1 + Chemo alone. The phase 3 has to 
                              prove the drug can improve the standard of care. This might only be for a small population of patients 
                              with a disease. Sometimes a drug can improve outcomes for patients with a specific form of the disease or 
                              a specific mutation of a cancer. If the phase 3 is successful, then company will file for a New Drug 
                              Application (NDA).

                         <p>
                              The FDA will take 60 days to look over the package and then accept or decline it.
                              A normal review takes 10 months. If the drug gets and expedited review, then it only takes 6 months. 
                              Some statuses issued by the FDA can speed up the process for review to the 6 months time point like 
                              fast track designation. Once accepted, they will issue a PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act) date 
                              by which they will issue a ruling. Sometimes, a drug will need what they call a Post Marketing Study 
                              or a phase 4 study. This is usually a long term follow up study to ensure long term safety or efficacy. 
                              Its not very often you will see these studies, but its important to know they exist if you see one.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The main keys to seeing a good trial design is that it has only 1 variable between the group with 
                              the study drug and the control group. Some studies do not use a control group. This usually 
                              happens in very bad disease where it would be unethical to use a control group. That is usually 
                              when they compare data to historical data they know from the history of the disease. A blinded 
                              study means the doctors and patients don't get to know who is on study drug and who is on placebo.
                              Open label means both the patients and doctors get to know who is on drug. These can be used to 
                              explore an indication. Some studies will undergo a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) by 
                              a panel of doctors who don't get to see anything but the data.
