                              Caribou is a gene editing and cell therapy company. They use the CAS12 enzyme with their proprietary 
                              chRDNA guide technology. They chose to deploy their technology in developing cell therapies. They are working 
                              on T cells ex-vivo and induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for NK cell therapies. I think they are using the CAR-T 
                              therapies to test out key edits like PD-1 knockout and MHC I knockout and HLA-E insertion. These key edits can 
                              drive advancements in cell therapies. Eventually, they will combine all the successful edits into all their therapies.

                              CB-010 is their CD19 CAR-T therapy where they use allogeneic T cell from donors. They edit these cells 
                              to knock out the PD-1 receptor. This protects these cells from the tumor microenvironment by preventing T cell 
                              exhaustion. The early data was very impressive for an allogeneic program with 100% complete response rates. The 
                              only issue was the durability still fell off at 6 months like other allogeneic programs. The effects of PD-1 knockout 
                              improved efficacy, but not durability which is the key issue in allogeneic programs.

                              CB-011 is their BCMA CAR-T therapy where they knocout the MHC I and replace it with HLA-E. This is designed to 
                              prevent cell from being rejected by the host immune system. We know that HLA-E helps prevent NK cell reject, but not 
                              completely. We will have to see how much benefit this edit really gives to druability. They are calling their 
                              version of immune evasion Camouflage.

                              knock out PD-1. This program has both edits of the prior therapies. This is designed to 
                              prevent cell from being rejected by the host immune system and avoid T cell exhaustion. We know that
                              HLA-E helps prevent NK cell reject. We will have to see how much benefit these edits have combined. This will

                              CB-020 is their preclinical induced Pluripotent Stem Cell platform for NK cells. It 
                              is targeting ROR1 which is part of the Wnt signaling pathway. We haven't seen much from this 
                              platform so far. I think they are using the T cells to test the edits so they know which ones 
                              work best before 
                              using them in the iPSC programs.

                              CB-010 is a CD19 program for lymphomas. That is about 75,000 patients in the US. So far this is 
                              the best in class allogeneic program. I think it could earn about $500 million in sales unless the data 
                              signifcantly improves. They have some early phase 1 data so I would give it .5 multiple. That is $250 million
