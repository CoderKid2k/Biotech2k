                              Verve is one of the two companies working with Base Editing. They licensed the technology from Beam 
                              Therapeutics. They have the right to pick 4 gene targets for cardiovascular diseases. They have picked 
                              PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 so far, and have 2 more they can pick. They have a license for CRISPR CAS12 which
                              they license from Broad Institute and Harvard. Verve has a development platform for guided 
                              LNP delivery. They have a delivery technology for their liver targets which is designed to target GalNac.
                              Beam licenses this guided LNP from them for some of its liver programs.

                              VERV-101 is a gene editing therapy that knocks out the PCSK9 gene. This is a gene associated with cardiovascular 
                              disease. They have some promising early data for the knock down of LDL. The early data in the preclinic showed 
                              about 67% LDL-C reduction. We will have to wait and see how that translates into humans with the phase 1 data.

                              VERV-201 is a gene editing therapy that knocks out the ANGPTL3 gene. This gene plays a role in triglyceride 
                              metabolism. The animal data here showed about a 96% reduction in the ANGPTL3. They are working on the IND enabling 
                              studies and hope to have the IND in 2024.

                              VERV-101 I think this will be a very competitive space competing with other PCSK9 antibodies and RNAi therapies.
                              I think they will get only a small market share of the patient is HeFH. I would estimate about 20,000 patients 
                              a year at a price of $40,000. That comes out to about $800 million in sales. I would give them a .1 multiplier
                              for being in early phase 1. That comes to $80 million value.
