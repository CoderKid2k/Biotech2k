                              This company is one that I am really excited to talk about as I think they are a CRISPR company of high 
                              innovation. Many people focus on the labs like Dr Liu who brought to us technologies like Base Editing 
                              and Prime Editing. Arbor is another company on the cutting edge of new discovery. They have sequenced the 
                              CRISPR from many organisms and identified over 60 CAS nucleases and over 70 Transposons. They are working 
                              on breakthroughs in new ways to do editing. They just recently signed a partnership with Vertex for their 
                              reverse transcriptase editor. They have a lot of technology here around CRISPR systems 
                              and could come up with some unique combinations of technology to drive new gene editors. They even have 
                              some Type 1 CAS enzymes which work as dimers.

                              They have their pipeline page up on their website now. They have several indications they are working
                              on. The first is ABO-101 for Primary Hyperoxaluria. This is a rare disease that stems from a defect in 
                              an enzyme that allows for Oxalate build up which can be toxic. Their second indication is for ATTR which 
                              has been a popular target of RNAi and CRISPR companies. They have a few other undisclosed targets showing 
                              up in their pipeline page.
