                              Beam is the company behind base editing. This takes the CRISPR CAS9 enzyme system and uses
                              it to alter a single base in the DNA. It uses a form of the CAS9 enzyme called a Nickase. This 
                              version of CAS9 is 
                              developed with only 1 of the nucleases active so that it can only cut a single strand of the DNA. 
                              It uses a deaminase enzyme attached to the CAS9 nickase. This enzyme plucks an amino group from the DNA base. 
                              This facilitates the transition of that  base from an Adenine to Guanine or a Cytosine to a Thymine.
                              Then it cuts the unedited strand which allows the DNA repair machinery to use the changed base to fix the 
                              mismatch of bases after deamination. Beam 
                              is the only company that owns this technology. They do license it to other companies for use. Beam is also 
                              working on next generation base editors.

                              BEAM-101 is the first stage of development for SCD. They are extracting, editing and replacing stem 
                              cells from patients by editing the stem cells to flip the switch back to producing Fetal Hemoglobin. 
                              This is in phase 1 and enrolling patients, but has no data yet. The preclinical data showed powerful 
                              60% Fetal Hb production. The next stage of development is going to combine the first stage with a CD117
                              conditioning regimen. This is far safer than Busulfan myeloablation. They have to add a single extra 
                              edit to the stem cells to modify the binding site for CD117. This allows the CD117 antibodies to clear 
                              all the unaltered stem cells while avoiding the newly engineered stem cells. The final stage of this program 
                              will move to actually editing the stem cells in-vivo, fixing them to a Makassar variant of healthy Hemoglobin.

                              BEAM-201 is a CAR-T therapy that is engineered using base editing. It targets the CD7 protein on T cells. 
                              This is designed for T cell based ALL. Most of ALL is B cell, and there are many companies working in this space.
                              T cell ALL is one area where new therapies are needed. This is starting phase 1 and has no data yet.

                              BEAM-301 is a gene editing product targeting the G6PC gene that has a single base mutation. Their therapy 
                              targets flipping that single base back to the wild type. Mouse models show modest return to normal fasting
                              glucose. This affects only the R83C mutation of the GSDIa disease. They plan to submit an IND in early 2024.

                              The data suggests this variant functions normally. They plan to file and IND in early 2024.

                              BEAM-101 is for SCD. There are 90,000 patients in the US and over 300,000 patients world wide with SCD. 
                              There will need to be more than one company to service this large patient population with the limited manufacturing 
                              capacity these companies will have. I think they could easily do at least 1,000 patients a year and maybe expand
                              upward to 2,000 a year. At a price of around $2.5 million per patient, that is $2.5 to $5 billion in revenues. I would 
                              put a .1 multiplier on this program until we see some data. That makes it worth about $500 million in value.

                              BEAM-201 is for T cell ALL. My best math says this would be about 3,300 patients per year. This is a smaller indication 
                              but would afford pricing power and less competition. I could see this doing $500 million in sales depending on the 
                              price. I would give this a .1 multiplier until we see some data for $50 million value.

                              The BEAM-301 program is for GSD1a with the most common mutation of R83C. This is about 3,000 to 6,000 patients 
                              based on the numbers I could find. That is a smaller indication, but I think pricing would be equal to SCD or higher.
                              I think this could be worth more than $1 billion. I would give it a .1 
                              multiplier since it is still preclinic. That would make it worth $100 million in value.

                              AATD is about 100,000 patients in the US. It is estimated that 90% of them are PiZZ genotype.
                              This could be a huge indication like SCD where they could do upward of $5 billion sales 
                              if they can manufacture enough doses per year.
                              I would give it a .1 multiplier since its still preclinic. That would make it worth $500 million value.
