                              AbCellera is using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to focus on developing 
                              antibodies. This is a huge space of development with over 164 antibodies in development.
                              They only work through partners and have no pipeline of their own. They use Artificial Intelligence 
                              to help sequence and design antibodies. They can even model the simulation of each antibody's response.
                              They can use Machine Learning to help pick antibodies that perform exactly to specifications.

                              AbCellera doesn't have a pipeline of its own. They have over 164 antibodies in 
                              development with over 38 partners.

                              AbCellera doesn't present any data for the assets they help partners design and develop. They do have 
                              2 commercial antibodies developed against Covid. They get royalties on all the programs they develop. 
                              To really follow AbCellera, you would have to follow all their partners with the data. That makes it more 
                              complex for the average investor. They currently have 2 commercial drugs with 7 more in the clinic.

                              Revenues next year are estimated to decline by over 70% to $110 million. That is worth about
                              $500 million based on a standard 5 multiplier for biotech companies.

                              I think they could yield over $2 billion royalties should all their programs work out. They 
                              get royalties on these programs. All their current programs are in the early stage of development so 
                              I would value that at .5x multiplier. That would make the pipeline worth about $1 billion in value.

                              All in, that is a $2.368 billion market cap. Based on the 286 million shares outstanding
                              on the 10Q, that comes to $8.27.
