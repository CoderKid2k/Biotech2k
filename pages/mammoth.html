                              Mammoth Biosciences has 2 platforms based off CRISPR technology. The first uses CAS enzymes
                              for DNA or RNA as a Diagnostic tool. They already have commercial Covid test using this type of CRISPR diagnostic 
                              reporter tool. The other program they are working on are new CAS enzymes with CAS-Phi and CAS-14. 
                              These are dramatically smaller than the older CAS9 enzymes. I call them the CAS-mini. They don't 
                              have any clinical programs for these newer CAS enzymes yet. I would think they would want some 
                              kind of clinical pipeline with these assets before going public. I don't think the diagnostics 
                              alone makes them as compelling for value. I believe at their last financing round they were valued 
                              around $1 billion. That would be expensive should all they have is diagnostics at the time of the 
                              IPO. They would have to have a ton of diagnostic revenues to justify that value. Overall, I rank 
                              them as the best of the private CRISPR companies because they do offer to very diverse platforms 
                              with CRISPR based technology with Diagnostic and Therapeutics.

                              Their diagnostics platform takes a guide RNA for the sequence they wish to find. 
                              They include a reporter strand that matches the DNA sequence for the genetic sequence they want to 
                              find. The CAS enzyme uses 
                              the guide RNA to find the right sequence in the DNA or RNA. Then it activates the nuclease which 
                              cuts the DNA or RNA. It will also cut the reporter molecules that are added. This causes them to 
                              activate and read out.
                         <p class="profiles">
                              The CAS14 and CAS Phi are much smaller variants of the CRISPR enzymes. They are about half the size of 
                              the original CAS9 enzyme. This makes them pefect for working in already existing AAV vectors which are too 
                              small for older CAS9. They can also adapt them for a version of base editing or even prime editing.
