                              Relay is working on a suite of tools using physics based chemistry, computational
                              modeling, AI and ML to discovery drugs where many others have failed before. They use
                              technologies to model proteins and enzymes in motion. Most people think of proteins as
                              static structures that just fold based on electrostatic and hydrophobic forces.
                              Proteins are actually very dynamic structures that perform functions and change their
                              shape as they function. Relay is developing technologies to model proteins in motion so they
                              can use other AI technologies to develop drugs against impossible targets. They will use
                              AI to help screen targets and model the dynamics of these molecules for safety and efficacy.
                              They use Machine Learning to screen thousands of possible drug candidates to pick the perfect
                              ones that are worth moving into the clinics. They are using these technologies to take on
                              some of the most toxic targets in Oncology.

                              RLY-4008 - Their first drug is for FGFR2 which is a target that previously had high levels of 
                              toxicity related to
                              this drug class. Relay developed a FGFR2 inhibitor with significantly better efficacy and significantly
                              lower toxicity than all drugs before it. They wowed investors with an 88% overall response rate in
                              phase 1 data. The safety data was very impressive compared to previous drugs in this class.

                              RLY-2608 - The second drug is for PI3Ka which has been a target
                              of oncology in the past, but failed repeatedly due to toxicity related to glucose regulation.
                              They made a major breakthrough here by targeting specific mutations in this protein that are not in
                              the wild type. This allows them to specifically target just the mutants of the protein and let the wild
                              type untouched. Early safety data looked very clean. Now we need to see the efficacy data.

                              pathway. They partnered it 50/50 with Sanofi. I would give them $250 million
                              because I am not sold on this target yet.
