                              Invitae is a company that does genetic testing using kits. They test for things like Cancer 
                              Genetics, Rare Genetic Disease and Women's Healthy. They generate over 3 million samples per year and
                              continue to grow. 
                              This makes them like the Google of Genomics information. They allow patient to share their information
                              which can lead to patients getting matched with doctors or scientists who are doing clinical trials
                              that might apply to them. This can provide powerful population level genetics to scientists and 
                              researchers alike who are doing research on these diseases.

                             The Oncology space of genetic test is expected to grow to over $30 billion a year market size. There is a huge 
                             genetics market for oncology as ever tumor for every patient is unique. There is a need for multiple tests 
                             per patient throughout their course of treatement. There is a high level of relpase rates in cancer which 
                             will drive continued testing. The more we understand oncology the more important the need for genetics profiling 
                             of tumors becomes. This space will only continue to grow as personalized cancer treatments become more popular.
                             One of the major current drivers of oncology is the Minimal Residual Detection (MRD) of cancer.
