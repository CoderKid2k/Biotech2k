                              Twist is the DNA company. They have multiple platforms around DNA technologies. They have a business
                              around DNA synthesis for the synthetic biology space. This business makes and sells DNA for biotech 
                              applications. They have a second business for DNA sequencing kits. Their third business is around designing antibodies for drug 
                              discovery companies. Their last business is for DNA as a storage system for data. They currently have sales for 
                              the synthetic biology and kits businesses. The rest is being developed for potential future growth.

                              I have only been following Twist for about a year. I think Emily Leproust is doing a great job at running 
                              the company. She seems to do a great job balancing the short term performance of sales with investing in 
                              the future with new areas of development. They have two commercial segments that earn revenues while driving 
                              growth. They are investing their cash into building out new areas around biopharma and DNA storage.

                              Their key technology is DNA synthesis on a chip. They are capable of packing a million oligo pools onto a 
                              single chip that can synthesize DNA. They reduce the amount of nucleotides used by 98% which saves on 
                              cost. They sell DNA made by their synthesis business where anyone can submit a strand of DNA code, and 
                              they will synthesize it and ship it to order. It is a great business with them doing DNA for the 
                              Synthetic Biology space and Ginkgo Bioworks.

                              They have a second business in the Next Gen Sequencing space by developing various testing kits. They have 
                              various different kits they offer for sale which offer higher efficiency than other kits in this space. 
                              Their kits are 50% more efficient for the required amount of sequencing needed. This is another business 
                              that does well.

                              They have a third business around developing antibodies for biotech companies. This is a very early stage
                              business and it takes time for these programs to go through development and reach commercial use. They 
                              use their expertise around DNA to help design these antibody therapies. They get milestones and 
                              royalties on these programs.

                              Their last business is around developing DNA for storage of information. This can only be profitable if 
                              they can reach the level of storage that makes it profitable. That makes this a challenging and risky 
                              area of expansion as we don't know if they will ever be able to reach that level. They plan to have an 
                              initial product to test by the end of this year.

                              They currently have $265 million in estimated 2023 sales. Even with a low 5 multiple on those sales, that 
                              would be worth $1.325 billion in valuation.

                              They have an entire pipeline of partners in the antibodies development space. It is really hard to value 
                              this pipeline right now until we know more about the programs and the data they achieve. We don't know
                              what kind of milestones or royalties they get on these programs. This could be a huge driver of value 
                              in the future. I would give this segment a valuation of $250 million value.
