                              Mirati is developing kinase inhibitors focused on oncology. They have several drugs 
                              in development targeting different pathways that drive cancer growth. There are many pathways 
                              inside cells that can mutate and drive the growth of cancer cells. Finding these genetic 
                              mutations and developing small molecule inhibitors to target those specific mutations is what 
                              targeted therapy is all about.

                              Adagrasib targets a mutation in a key growth pathway called KRAS G12C. The pathway is the RAS pathway 
                              which is a key growth pathway in all cells. Mutations in this pathway drive uncontrolled cell growth. 
                              KRAS is a form of RAS that affects tissues like the Lungs, Pancreas and Colon. There are different mutations 
                              for KRAS with G12C making up about 32% of the KRAS mutation types. Its one of the most common and plays a big 
                              role in NSCLC and CRC. It makes up about 14% of Lung Adenocarcinomas. The data for this program showed over 40%
                              ORR and good CNS pentration as upward of 50% of KRAS NSCLC patients have brain mets.

                              MRTX1133 targets another mutation of KRAS with the G12D mutation. This is the second most common type of KRAS 
                              mutation representing about 23% of the KRAS mutations. This plays a larger role in Pancratic cancer and less of 
                              a role in NSCLC. This is in IND enabling studies with no data yet.

                              Sitravatinib targets a faimily of kinase called the TAM family of kinases. This family shows strong promise at
                              affecting cells within the tumor microenvironment. It has multiple benefits like shifting Macrophages back from 
                              the M2 subtype to the M1 subtype which makes them able to target tumor cells. This is in a long term Overall Survival 
                              trial in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.

                              MRTX1719 is a PRMT5 inhibitor for MTAP deleted cancers. There is scientific evidence to show that MTAP deleted 
                              cancers have a high dependence on PRMT5. This drug is designed to target those cancers by blocking this pathway 
                              they have become dependent on. This is just starting phase 1 and has no data yet.

                              Adagrasib affects KRAS G12C in NSCLC and CRC. This is about 10,000 patients in NSCLC, of which, they will compete with other companies 
                              in this indication. I think they could get at least half of them since they have best in class data with CNS penetration.
                              At a price of $200,000, that would be $1 billion in sales. I think it could expand to $1.5 billion if CRC is 
                              successful. I would give this a 3x multiple on the $1 billion that is commercial. That is $3 billion in value.

                              MRTX1133 affects KRAS G12D in Pancreatic and CRC. This is about 15,000 in pancreatic and 10,000 CRC patients in the US.
                              Depending on the data, this could get at least 50% of the market share for about 12,000 total patients. At a price of 
                              $200,000, that would be $2.4 billion in sales. There will eventually be competitors in this space. I would give this 
                              .1 multiple for being in preclinic. That is worth $240 million value.

                              Sitravatinib is very hard to determine the patient population for PD-1 refractory patients. I think it could earn
                              at least $500 million in sales. I don't have a lot of value for this indication. I think it could be worth $1 billion 
                              of value with the phase 2 data so far.

                              MRTX1719 is an early drug for MTAP deleted cancers. My best guess numbers is at least 10,000 pateints across various 
                              types of cancer. I think this could be worth $1 billion in sales if it works out well. That would make it worth $100
