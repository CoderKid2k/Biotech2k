                              CRISPR is one of the original CRISPR CAS9 companies. They use the original CAS9 enzyme to do gene editing.
                              Due to the possible risks of using a double stranded break in a person, they have focused on using the technology 
                              for editing cells outside of humans like stem cell and T cell therapies. They are the most advanced company in 
                              the CRISPR space. Their lead drug for SCD has been submitted for commercial approval. They recently started 
                              to advance some early new programs around in-vivo gene knockout.

                              Exa-cel is their lead program for SCD and Beta Thalassemia. This works by extracting the patient's stem cells and 
                              editing them to flip the genetic switch back to making Fetal Hemoglobin. They treat the patients with Busulfan
                              to get rid of all the old stem cells. Then they treat them with the new edited stem cells. It is a long and extensive
                              process. This has very strong data at producing high levels 
                              of Fetal Hemoglobin and eliminating Vaso Occlusive Crisis. This therapy has been submitted for FDA approval.

                              CTX-110 is their first CAR-T therapy for CD19. It is an allogeneic therapy where they take donor T cells and 
                              edit them before giving them to a patient. These cells don't have any advanced edits, and the data has been
                              very weak compared to other allogeneic CAR-T programs.

                              CTX-130 is their second CAR-T therapy. It is an allogeneic therapy focused on CD70. This still lacks the key 
                              edits and the data is still on par with other allogeneic programs. This is being developed for solid tumors.

                              VCTX-210 is their Diabetes therapy they are working on with ViaCyte. This program works on creating islet cells 
                              from stem cell sources and placing them in a capsule that is inserted inside the body. This has some challenges 
                              as the encapsulated islet cells have a hard time responding to insulin.

                              Exa-cel is shared with Vertex with CRISPR getting only 40% of the revenues. I think they could do about 1,000 doses 
                              per year to start and maybe ramp from there. At a price of $2.5 million, that would be worth $2.5 billion in revenues. 
                              That would be $1 billion that would go to CRISPR. I would give them 3x multiple for a program awaiting approval. That makes 
                              this program worth $3 billion in valuation.

                              CTX-110 is in the space of CD19 which is very competitive. Based on its data compared to peers, I really would 
                              not see this making much money if any at all. I gave it a $0 value.

                              CTX-130 is in the space of CD70. I would guess this could have a patient population of at least 10,000. It would 
                              depend on the data on how much market share. I would think this could be worth $1 billion revenues if successful.
                              I would give this a .5 multiplier as it has some phase 1 data. That would make it worth $500 million in value.

                              VCTX-210 is their islet cells for Diabetes. I don't think this will work. Even if it does, I doubt many would 
                              opt for this kind of implant. I give it no value until the data proves it works.

                              All in that is a $5.4 billion market cap. Based on the 78 million shares outstanding, that comes to $69.23.
