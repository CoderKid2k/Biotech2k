                              Exscientia is developing Artificial Intelligence for use in discovery of new drugs 
                              and clinical therapies. Their first platform is about using single cell genomics data 
                              to allow Artificial Intelligence to model the best combination of drugs in cancer therapies. 
                              Their second platform is about using Artificial Intelligence to take all the collected information 
                              from science literature and use it with Artificial Intelligence to find new ways to treat 
                              cancer.

                              EXALT 1 - This is the program which is focused on doing single cell biopsies in patients 
                              with hematologic and solid tumors. They showed a 30% improvement to outcomes for patients who 
                              had their therapy protocol designed by the AI vs those who were on Physician's choice.

                              EXS-21546 - The target of this drug is A2A receptor which is overly expressed across many cancers. It
                              works much like a checkpoint for the immune response. There have been several drugs developed in this space 
                              that didn't do so well, but they were not using AI. The early safety data looks encouraging, but we are 
                              still waiting to see efficacy data.

                              GTAEXS-617 - This drug targets CDK7 which is a Cyclin Dependent Kinase involved in the cell cycle. This plays 
                              a role in starting DNA replication. It has a role in activating the Polymerase. There is no data for this molecule 
                              yet, but it makes sense for targeting cell growth in cancer.

                              and the formation of the Inflammasome. This could be a very interesting target with a very large patient

                              Since this is a diagnotic and therapy tool and not a drug, I find it hard to predict how much this would 
                              really earn. I do think it could do $100 million or more, but not really sure. I would give it $100 million 
                              worth of value.

                              This could be a big indication with the size of the Immune Oncology market. I think this could 
                              be worth $1 billion in sales depending on the data. They have some early phase 1 safety data. I would 
                              give the .75 multiple because they don't fully own this asset. That would make it worth $750 million 
                              value.

                              Their next drug is for CDK7. This could be a big indication as CD4/6k inhibitors do over $5 billion 
                              a year. This would be used in combination. I think they could see $1 billion sales depending on the
                              data. This program is owned 50% by Exscientia. It is still in the preclinic. I would give them a .1 
                              multiple for a $100 million in value.

                              Their early stage program for NLRP3 really excites me. This is a potential target in inflammation. The 
                              inflammation market is huge. This could easily be worth over $2 billion worth of potential depending
                              on the data they generate. Since it is only preclinical, I would only give it .1 multiple for $200 million
                              worth of value.

                              on the financial reports, that comes to $13.30.
