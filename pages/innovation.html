                       This section is about the discovery and the tracking of science in the biotechnology industry that is 
                       leading the innovation of the future. Here I will look at the technologies driving the science forward.
                       This is about finding the cutting edge of science around Genetics, Immunology and Oncology. Those are the 
                       areas I focus on. These will be just my opinions and ideas. The innovation section is designed to give ideas for
                       investors as a jumping off point. I don't know if all of these areas of innovation will work out. Sometimes
                       great science still fails. Sometimes it runs into challenges or just doesn't live up to expectations. This 
                       innovation section will change as science evolves. There will always be science that matures while new 
                       science is discovered. This section will always be about "what's next"?

                          This area on innovation is all about bringing technology
                         into biotechnology. The high cost of drug prices is driven by the high cost of
                         drug discovery. The statistics show that a drug can cost well over $1 billion to
                         develop and 90% of the drugs that enter phase 1 fail. The high cost comes from 
                         the high level of failure. Bringing technology into the discovery process can help 
                         lower the cost. It can automate complex processes by replacing workers with robotics. 
                         This can save a lot on cost. Automation in the lab is a big cost savings to many 
                         companies. The other place where technology can really help is using Artificial 
                         Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to improve on the rate of success
                         and help lower costs. In traditional drug discovery, hundreds of molecules would have to be 
                         tested by hand in the lab to see which molecule would perform best. The use of AI and ML 
                         algorithms can screen thousands of molecules and model which ones have the highest rates
                         of success. This can significantly reduce cost and improve rates of success. The use of 
                         AI can also be used to take genetic and biological data and make connections between
                         mechanisms of biology and genetics that we may never have thought of before. This can open 
                         up new potential breakthroughs in diseases that have been hard to crack like Alzheimer's 
                         The future of biotechnology will belong to the companies that embrace these new technologies.
                         Technology can improve the ability of companies to make drugs cheaper and with higher
                         rates of success. This could significantly reduce drug cost over the long term.

                    <p class="large-text">
                         CRISPR is a gene editing tool which can revolutionize the way we treat genetic diseases 
                         and completely create new ways to take on other diseases like cancer. It offers a low cost, easy to use, and very
                         powerful set of tools to alter the DNA. Since its discovery, it has already completely
                         changed the landscape of biotechnology. This gives us the ability to rewrite the human
                         code. We can build therapies using cells by reprogramming them. We can knock out 
                         genes that cause harm. We can insert new genes and replace a lost gene. We can fix a gene
                         that has a mutation. The biggest benefit from CRISPR will be what it can do in cell engineering.
                         It offers the ability to engineer complex cells like stem cells or immune cells that can target
                         and kill cancer. It can be used to create new life in plants that can resist drought or grow bigger.
                         It can engineer microbes that can produce fertilizer right in the field for the plants. It can be
                         used to engineer microbes that become sustainable manufacturing for ingredients.
                         The ability of gene editing tools to give us the ability to change the genetic code of people, plants,
                         animals, and microbes could change the world. It can help us solve some of our biggest environmental issues like carbon 
                         emissions and global warming. Combined with other technologies, it can be a very powerful tool.

                    <p class="large-text">
                         Synthetic Biology is about taking the tool that is CRISPR gene editing and combining it with the 
                         technology of cell engineering to create new life. It is about taking microbes and rewriting their DNA
                         to create new organisms that have beneficial impacts. We can make microbes that produce sustainable sources
                         of key proteins or chemical ingredients. We can make
                         organisms that produce fertilizer right in the soil. We can use it to build plants that are better at
                         surviving and produce higher yields. We can make microbes to detect or even clean pollution and other
                         toxins in the environment. We can use it to produce cells in humans that work as therapies. Combining 
                         cell engineering, chemistry and gene editing could allow us to rewrite life on Earth. It could eventually
                         allow us to colonize and survive on other planets.

                    <h2 class="section-title">iPSC</h2>
                    <p class="large-text">
                         Induced Pluripotent Stem cells is an older technology that was discovered about 10 years
                         ago. It was about taking differentiated cells like skin cells, and engineering them back
                         into stem cells where they can be used for new therapies. They use a series of transcription
                         factors which remodel the DNA of the cells and turn them back into the stem cells state. For
                         a long time this technology really had no purpose. Then along came CRISPR gene editing and
                         everything changed. The ability to take these stem cells produced by iPSC and edit them using
                         CRIPR opened up endless possibilities. We can now engineer stem cells that can advance down
                         any cell lineage to create all kinds of therapies. One such example is creating new islet cells
                         for Diabetes. This science is now in its infancy and the possibilities are endless. Someday, we 
                         will be able to take sample cells from a patient and create whole organs from iPSC cells by guiding
                         them down the path to differentiation. Today, the focus is on using them to create low cost
                         manufacturing for immune cells in cell therapies. They can edit a stem cell with all the desired edits
                         and use it to create a master bank of engineered stem cells. Then they can walk them down the path of growth
                         into T cells or NK cells for fighting cancer. This offers a low cost way to make thousands of doses
                         at an extremely low cost. The power of this technology isn't in a single therapy, but in how the 
                         technology will change the way we manufacture and develop new cell therapies.

                         Since the age of low cost genetic sequencing is upon us, we can now focus on creating therapies 
                         that are designed to target key genetic mutations in diseases like cancer. We can sequence 
                         these tumors and get the types of mutations that distinguish them from healthy cells. Then
                         we can create therapies that target these key mutations. We have seen this space evolve 
                         over the past decade with breakthroughs like KRAS G12C. There are so many other mutations
                         out there that can be addressed with these therapies like PI3Ka. There are hundreds of proteins and 
                         enzymes inside a cell that regulate the process of growth and proliferation. Many of them
                         mutate in different cancers. We can use genetic information and other technologies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors
                         and protein degraders to go after these specific mutations that separate cancer cells from
                         healthy cells. This brings with it a future where we can combine older therapies, with these Personalized
                         Therapies and even other technologies like cell therapies. When it comes to taking on very hard
                         diseases like cancer, we can use all the tools we can get.
