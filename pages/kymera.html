                              Kymera is working on targeted protein degradation. There is an organelle inside each cell called 
                              the Proteasome. This acts like the recycling center of the cell for proteins. When a protein is no 
                              longer needed, it gets tagged for degradation. Then it is loaded into the Proteasome where it gets
                              broken down into small fragments that can be used to make new proteins. The targeted protein degraders
                              go into the cell and tag proteins to have them degraded by the Proteasome. This can harnesses the cell
                              system to create a therapeutic way of removing harmful or unwanted proteins as therapies. Kymera is focused 
                              on using this technology to treat inflammation disorders and cancer.

                              KT-474 targets IRAK4 which is a pathway inside antigen presenting cells that activates the production of 
                              inflammatory cytokines like IL-1. The role of these inflammatory pathways in inflammatory diseases is well 
                              known. This therapy goes in and degrades the IRAK4 protein so it does not trigger the activation of the cytokines 
                              that lead to inflammation. There is early efficacy and safety data that shows it can lower symptoms in patients 
                              with skin inflammatory diseases. It will be turned over to their partner Sanofi which will now advance it through 
                              phase 2 trials for multiple inflammatory disorders like HS and Atopic Dermatitis.

                              KT-413 combines the IRAK4 degrader with the IMID degrader to target MyD88 driven tumors. These are typically 
                              B cell related cancers that are driven by the IRAK4 pathway. This is in phase 1, and we are waiting on data.

                              KT-333 inhibits the STAT3 pathway by targeting that protein for degradation. This is being developed for fibrotic 
                              diseases and oncology. It is just entering phase 1 for oncology targets and still in preclinic for fibrotic diseases.
                              We will have to wait and see how the data works out.

                              KT-253 targets MDM2 which is a protein that inhbits p53. The p53 protein is a key regulator of cell survival and 
                              DNA repair. The p53 gene is mutated in about 50% of cancers. This leads to a loss of this tumor suppressor gene. By 
                              blocking the inhibitor of p53, they can have higher level of the p53 protein in these cells. This is designed 
                              to increase the level of cell death signals in cancer cells. It is currently in IND enabling studies.

                              KT-474 has serveral indications in which it can show efficacy. Just based on the 2 indications 
                              it showed data on in phase 1, I think it could easily do $1 billion in sales if the data continues 
                              to do well or improves. There are even more indications in which it could be successful. I would give
                              this and 1x multipier as they do have full phase 1 data now. That gives them $1 billion in value.

                              KT-413 has a few smaller indications for B cell lymphomas where it would target MyD88 driven cancers. I think 
                              it could do about $500 million in sales if successful. It would get a .1 multiplier until we see some data from 
                              the phase 1 trial. That makes it worth $50 million value.

                              KT-333 could have really big potential if it works out well in Fibrotic disease and oncology. I would venture 
                              a guess of $2 billion in sales. It would depend on the data. I would give this .1 multiplier since its still early 
                              in phase 1 with no data. That makes it worth $200 million value.

                              KT-253 is really hard to predict since don't have any data on this program yet. I would venture a guess of $1 billion 
                              if all goes well. That would be worth $100 million value with being preclinical.
