                              Oxford uses what is called Nanopore technology. This uses a film with tiny pores in it. 
                              They pass a current across the film. Then the sequence is run through the pore. As each 
                              different nucleotide passes through the pore, it will make a different sound. This allows the 
                              software to record those sounds and build a consensus of the sequence being processed. This 
                              is long read sequencing technology. My biggest concern for this company is the stock trades on
                              the European exchanges. It is only listed in the US on the over the counter markets. They allow 
                              for US investors to own the company, but the OTC market is extremely illiquid.

                            When it comes to sequencing, the nanopore technology tends to have the strength of versatility. 
                            They have a selection of machines which allow for different applications based on the users needs. 
                            This is definately one of their strengths. They have significantly closed the gap on accuracy by improving
                            this technology and the consensus read software.

                              They currently have about $200 million in annual sales projected for 2022. The market for sequencing is estimated to double 
                              from 2022 to 2026 from $7 billion to $14 billion. With multiple products on the market, I think Oxford 
                              could capture at least $1 billion in sales over the long term. At just 10x sales, that would be worth $5 billion 
                              market cap. Their current value would be around $2 billion based on current sales.

                              They don't have clinical data as much as they have accuracy rates for their secquencing technology 
                              they develop. They will continue to drive down cost per genome sequenced over time.
