                              Intellia is one of the original CRISPR CAS9 companies. They use the original CAS9 enzyme to do gene editing.
                              Due to the possible risks of using a double stranded break in a person, they have focused on using the technology 
                              for editing cells outside of humans like stem cell and T cell therapies. They also proved safety and efficacy of
                              in human gene knockout. They are also working on building their own versions of base editing and possibly 
                              gene writing from their acquisition of Rewrite.

                              NTLA-2001 is their first therapy for in-vivo gene knockout of the ATTR gene. This is to remove the unwanted 
                              ATTR proteins that are made from mutated genes. This is in phase 1 and the data showed up to 93% knock down of 
                              the unwanted ATTR protein in serum.

                              NTLA-2002 is their second therapy targeting the Kallikrein gene for knock out. The historical data from HAE 
                              shows that the knock down of Kallikrein in the plasma can reduce the attacks from HAE. This program is in phase 1
                              and they have some initial data showing up to 92% reduction in Kallikrein. They also showed an attack free 
                              event time improvement.

                              NTLA-3001 is their therapy for AAT where they attempt to insert the SERPINA1 gene. I would think they are attempting 
                              this by Homology Directed Repair using a template strand. I find this program extremely concerning as so much 
                              could go wrong with this program. I expect it to fail and be discontinued for NTLA-2003.

                              NTLA-2003 is their therapy for AAT where they attempt to knockout the SERPINA1 gene. I suspect this would 
                              work very much like RNAi knockout programs for this target, but in a permanent manor. I find this program 
                              safer than the NTLA-3001 approach. It would compete with RNAi in a competitive space though.

                              NTLA-6001 is allogeneic CAR-T therapy targeting CD30 in Lymphomas. They are testing out a potential 
                              immune evasion strategy where they knock out the HLA-A but match the HLA-B and HLA-C. I honestly do not 
                              see the value to this. It seems like a really weak attempt at immune evasion. The whole point of knocking 
                              out HLA is so you don't have to match. I wait and see the data though. My guess is it gets dropped.

                              NTLA-2001 is shared 75% Intellia and 25% Regeneron. Their first program is for hATTR. This is about
                              50,000 world wide. I think they could do about 2,000 per year for at least
                              $2 million price as RNAi alternatives cost nearly $600,000 per year. I could see at least up to
                              $4 billion sales. That would entitle Intellia to $3 billion in sales. With good phase 1 data, I would 
                              put this multiple at .5 right now. That makes it worth $1.5 billion value.

                              give this program .5 multiple based on the early data. That makes it worth $500 million value.

                              in the US. I think they could capture a few thousand of them for $2 million price. That could make
