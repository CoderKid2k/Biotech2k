                              Fate is the original company to develop induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. They have been leading 
                              the space for many years. The biggest issue with being first is the science often moves faster 
                              than the clinical trials. It did not take long to realize these early therapies were already outdated. 
                              They did not have key edits to avoid immune rejection of the cells. I think Fate did the right 
                              thing with scrapping all these older programs to move new programs into the clinic which have these 
                              key edits. I hope they go down the road of using common progenitor cells as a starting stock. They 
                              kept 2 key programs for NK cells and T cells. These look to be indications where they think they can 
                              still drive potential for patients.

                              FT-576 is a CAR-NK cell therapy using a BCMA target. It has the enhanced CD16 receptor for improved use 
                              with antibody therapies. It has the CD38 knockout so it can be combined with anti-CD38 antibodies for 
                              Multiple Myeloma. This program is just entering phase 1, but data could help inform us to how well this combination 
                              could work in Multiple Myeloma.

                              FT-819 is their first iPSC derived CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19. This does not have the immune evasion edits 
                              so I am not sure why they chose to keep this program. Maybe, they just wanted to validate the CAR-T platform 
                              using this asset before they move into newer cells. They will need to add the immune evasion edits to all new 
                              CAR-T cell therapies.

                              FT-576 is for Multiple Myeloma which affects over 30,000 patient in the US alone. This will compete with other
                              BCMA cell therapies. It would have to distinguish itself from the many other programs in this indications. I think 
                              with the edits and combinations it has, it really could. I would give this $1 billion potentail if it works out well.
                              It gets a .1 multiplier for having no data yet. That is $100 million in value.

                              FT-819 is their CD19 CAR-T for Lymphoma. This does not have the immune evasion edits. I don't think this program 
                              will go beyond phase 1 to validate the concept of making iPSC derived T cells. I think they will eventually replace 
                              this will CAR-T therapies with more edits.
