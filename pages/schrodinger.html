                              They are developing software used for drug discovery. Their primary software is about
                              physics based chemistry to design molecules. They are focused on translating physics based 
                              chemistry into computer aided design.
                              They have added a lot of other software around
                              the drug discovery process to include Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. They use the 
                              software that develops the chemitry models to train the machine learing algorithms.
                              They license this software to other companies. They recently started
                              using their own software to develop their own pipeline.

                              Wee1 - This target is one that has been attempted before by other companies, and it hasn't done so well.
                              Those companies did not have this level of software assisted engineering. We will have to wait and see 
                              the data, but there is always room for this to succeed where others have failed. This plays a role in the 
                              cycle. This comes in during the last cell checkpoint before moving into mitosis.

                              Sales are projected to be $194 million in revenues for 2023 with their software side of the business. 
                              The classic Price to Sales goes from 10x to 14x. Even at 10x that gets you $194 million * 10 for

                              MALT1 could be upward of $750 million for B cell related cancers. It won't work in all B cell cancers. 
                              It will be a subset that is driven by MALT1 signaling. Even so, there are limited targeted therapies
                              for those patients. If I give it a .1 multiplier since it has no data, I would get $75 million value.

                              CDC7 could do well over $1 billion in sales if it works well with CDK4/6 inhibitors which earn about $5 billion
                              a year. Even if it is only used in a small percentage of those patients, it could reach that $1 billion sales
                              potential. This is still in development so I would only give it a .1 multiplier. That puts it at about $100
