                              Data Readouts
                         </h2>

                         <p>
                              This section is about me taking actual clinical data readouts and breaking them down. I will take screenshots 
                              of key sections of the data release and explain what it means. I will use my understanding of the science
                              I focus on to show you how to evaluate data. The key is to then take that data and compare it to other competitors and 
                              the current standard of care. Any data read out can look good on its own. Then it has to be put into context to 
                              know where the data fits into the competitive landscape. I focus on Oncology and Genetics mostly so that is the 
                              kind of data you will learn about here. The key to learning to read any data is to figure out what the key measurements 
                              are for any indication. Oncology has its own like Overall Survival and RECIST response rates. In the same way Immunology or 
                              CNS indications have their key tests. The other important part is to ensure the trail design is valid. Too many 
                              times companies do not create good trails as they try to skew data to make it look better than it really does.

                              <a href="https://ir.relaytx.com/node/8161/pdf" target="_blank">RLY-4008 Phase 1 Data</a>
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Here we will look at the data from RLY-4008. The image below will open in a full window so you can read it and 
                              follow along with the data. The first image is the top section of the press release. Most of these press releases 
                              start the same. They have a few bullet points to point out key data. I will read them, but too many times companies 
                              will put data in the bullet points to make things look great, but when you read the actual data further down, it turns out to be
                              bad. Never just read only the bullet points as many investors do this and get the wrong impression.

                         <p>     
                             After the bullet points, there will be the section that highlights the data along with company comments on the 
                             data. This always comes with the quotes to highlight the company comments. I often call this the spin comments. 
                             Many times, when data is bad, the company will put spin on it in their comments to try to make it sound better 
                             than it really is. For this data read out of RLY-4008, they are pointing out a subset of patients that were treated 
                             only at the phase 2 dose. They show 15 of 17 responding for 88% Overall Response Rate. I don't have any problems 
                             with this type of data cutout. I still would look over the rest of the patients which showed 66% Overall Response 
                             Rates across all dose cohorts. The one word of caution I have is that a really awesome response rate of 88% can be misleading 
                             in these small patient populations as they often do not hold up to those high levels as the trials progress and 
                             the patient populations get bigger. Most FGFR2 inhibitors have response rates in the 20% to 30% which makes 88% more 
                             than 3x the response rates compared to other drugs in this space. That is a game changer if it holds up that level 
                             of response or doesn't give up a ton going into larger patient populations. 
                         </p>
                         <a href="../images/relayimage2.png" target="_blank">

                         </a>
                         <p>
                              The very first thing we see in the data section is they treated 195 total patients, of which, 89 of 
                              them were treated at the phase 2 dose of 70mg. The actual data is based on only 17 of those patients 
                              which reached enough follow up to be included in the data so far. That is only about 19% of the patients 
                              in the total trial were included. This still has a long way to go on data. Of the 15 patients that responded 
                              13 remain in response with 1 of them only coming off treatment to get their tumor removed with curative intent. 
                              That is very positive as the study drug shrank the tumor enough that they could remove it. The 2 people who 
                              did not respond were still in stable disease. They did not progress or get worse. That is another very 
                              positive data point. Out of all the patients who were treated in all dose cohorts, the response rate was 
                              63% which is still more than double the historical rate for other FGFR2 inhibitors.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last section is the Safety Data. They don't provide very in depth data for the safety at this point other 
                              than to say that most have been mild to moderate and manageable. This is encouraging as many FGFR2 inhibitors have 
                              a ton of toxicity. We will have to wait and see more detailed data on safety. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Overall, I would sum this up as very powerful early data in an indication which typically has low response 
                              rates and high toxicity. We still have 80% of the patients to see data on and it could change the response rate. 
                              The key now is to see more of the data develop to ensure the response rates stay strong and the safety stays 
                              clean. 
                         </p>
