                         <p> 
                              My system for valuing biotech is something I developed over the years. I built this system 
                              to be an easy way to get a general ball park valuation for a company so I can tell if its 
                              overvalued or undervalued. I built it from years of watching how company's stocks respond to
                              clinical data. The value a company loses or gains on a clincal data read out informs us to what 
                              the value was attributed to that program in the value of the stock. Then I have to assume 2 
                              variables in this value. The first is the value considers what the potential of the progam. A 
                              program that could do $1 billion in sales would be worth more than one that could do $250 million 
                              in sales. The second assumption is the value takes in consideration the level of validation of the
                              program. A phase 3 program is more validated than one in phase 1. It would have a bigger impact on
                              valuation than a program in phase 1. If both these assumptions are true, then we can use the move 
                              in a company's stock price based on a clinical failure or success to inform us of the value.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              My model is a sum of the parts model. I take each drug in the pipeline and figure out what it could earn 
                              in revenues at peak sales. Then I adjust that value based on the level of validation of that drug. That gives 
                              me the value for that single drug. Then I add up all the value for all the programs and add in the cash. 
                              If I have a drug worth $500 million value, a second worth $250 million, and the company has $500 million cash, 
                              my valuation would be $500 million + $250 million + $500 million = $1.25 billion value.
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              The key values here are estimating peak sales and adjusting those sales based on the level of clinical 
                              validation. You can often get estimates for sales from analysts or even the company. The harder 
                              way is more accurate, but takes more time. If you follow your companies, they will often define for you the 
                              size of the pateint population in their presentations. Then all you need to do is find prices of 
                              comparable drugs, and you can calculate peak sales. The only change would be to adjust for potential market share 
                              for competition. The level of validation for the drug would simply be the level of clinical success it has 
                              achieved. I take the peak sales and adjust them for the phase of development using .1x for preclinical, 1x for 
                              phase 1 data, 2x for phase 2 data, 3x for phase 3 data and 5x sales for a mature biotech valuation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once you have the value for each drug in the pipeline, you just add them up and add in the cash on the 
                              balance sheet. This will give you a total valuation for the company. You can compare the market cap you 
                              calculated to the current market cap to see if its too expensive or too cheap. You can even adjust your 
                              valuation based on the outstanding shares and get a stock price for that valuation. Every time a company 
                              reports they wil issue a 10Q or 10K. The very first page will list the number of outstanding shares at 
                              the time of reporting. You can divide you valuation by the shares outstanding and get a price target.
