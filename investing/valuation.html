                         <p> 
                              I have been valuing companies for about 27 years now. I was fascinated as a new investor on what 
                              made companies worth what they were worth. My first exploration into valuation was the classic 
                              Benjamin Graham with his book the Intelligent Investor. The is the man whom Warren Buffet studied 
                              under. It was all about paying for earnings. Most investors today would tell you that the valuation 
                              of the company is linked to the cash flows it produces. Many analysts now use a complex and very 
                              biased Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. But what about companies that are not profitable yet? 
                              After all, many of the best investments are early stage companies that are spending more than they 
                              make to drive growth. What are they really worth? Are they only worth the physical assets? Is 
                              there no value for technology and intellectual property? Here is a look at my evolution of looking 
                              at valuation over my 27 years as I went from a value investor to a growth investor with an eye for 
                              value.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="peratio">Price to Earnings Ratio</h2>
                         <p> 
                              When I first got started into the valuation game, I read the book "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin 
                              Graham. This book is the Bible of valuation. It was written in a time before the internet and the 
                              hyper growth companies.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              When doing valuation, it all comes down to what we will pay for earnings of a company. In a bull market, 
                              investors will often over pay for earnings. In a bear market, investors won't pay as much for those same 
                              earnings. We call the amount we pay for earnings the multiple. The multiple is based on earnings and it 
                              expands and compresses with the economy. Everyone has heard of the Price to Earnings multiple (P/E). 
                              That is the multiple we are talking about here. To give an example, I am going to use Apple.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              We have the Price of the stock at around $153. It has earned $5.89 in trailing 12 months earnings. Don't 
                              mistake that for full year earnings. Once we have the Price and the Earnings, the P/E is simple math. 
                              It is the Price divided by the Earnings. In this case it's $153/$5.89. That comes out to 25.97. That is 
                              how they calculate Price to Earnings multiple.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The average P/E is considered 15 from the classical Ben Graham valuation days, but they never had hyper 
                              growth companies back then. Some of these companies can have 50% to 150% growth when they go public. 
                              In that case, how do we know if we are expensive on this P/E? When it comes to Apple, some people might 
                              think a 26 P/E isn't all that bad for such a great company. Others might find it extremely expensive 
                              when it's historically traded at 15 P/E. The rule is, The higher the level of growth, the more 
                              investors will pay for those earnings. Often, I will do a P/E for the current year and then for next 
                              year. That will give you an idea of how expensive the company is on forward earnings. This helps 
                              compensate for growth. The future earnings for Apple are $6.58. That makes the forward P/E of $153/$6.58 
                              equals 23.25. The growth rate is the difference between the current earnings of $5.89 and $6.58 which 
                              is 11.7%. Paying a 23 P/E for a company growing at 11% growth seems very expensive to me.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              That is where we can adjust the P/E by the growth rate using another metric called Price to Earnings 
                              Growth (PEG) ratio. This takes the normal P/E and divides it further by the growth rate. We just 
                              calculated a forward P/E or 23 and growth rate of 11%. This is where we take the P/E and divide it by 
                              the growth rate or (23/11). That gives us a PEG ratio. In this case it is 2.09. The understanding for 
                              PEG ratio is that any company trading at less than 1 PEG ratio is very cheap. It's my experience that 
                              when a company has very high growth and the PEG is low, it is because investors do not trust the 
                              growth. When the PEG ratio is higher than 2, it is considered way too expensive. This can happen if 
                              the company has a very attractive dividend. Many companies like Apple here in our example are very 
                              expensive because they also have a dividend which gives them value above the level of growth in 
                              earnings. Many dividend companies will often trade at high PEG ratios as they have yield that supports 
                              the value where growth no longer exists. This is an example of classical Graham valuation, but what do 
                              you do when there is no earnings?

                         <p> 
                              Next I am going to look at a value metric for those kinds of companies. When a company has no 
                              Earnings, most investors will come up with all kinds of metrics to attempt to value them. I find the 
                              best metric is just Price to Sales. What is the Price to Sales ratio? This takes the Market Cap of 
                              the company and divides it by the total Revenues or Sales. In the Case of Apple it has a 2,400 billion 
                              market cap and 394 billion in sales. That makes the Price to Sales (2,400/394) or 6.09. I use P/S 
                              all the time in companies that don't have any earnings. You can even adjust this for growth like 
                              with the PEG ratio. Then I compare this with other companies in the sector and for the sector in 
                              general. There are sources on the internet where you can find the average Price to Sales ratio by 
                              industry. If your company is growing faster than the average company in the sector, then it's safe 
                              to assume it should have a higher Price to Sales ratio. The other thing to consider is profit 
                              margins. If 2 companies have the same sales, the one with a higher profit margin would get a higher 
                              valuation. I have seen this in healthy eating stocks in the past. When I had 2 companies with 
                              different Price to Sales ratio, the ones with higher growth and higher profit margins had a premium.

                         <p> 
                              My system for valuing biotech is something I developed over the years. I built this system to be an 
                              easy way to get a general ballpark valuation for a company so I can tell if it is overvalued or 
                              undervalued. I built it from years of watching how company's stocks respond to clinical data. The 
                              value a company loses or gains on a clinical data read out informs us to what the value was attributed 
                              to that program in the value of the stock. Then I have to assume 2 variables in this value. The first 
                              is the valuation takes into account the potential of the program. A program that could do $1 billion 
                              in sales would be worth more than one that could do $250 million in sales. The second assumption is 
                              the valuation takes in consideration the level of validation of the program. A phase 3 program is 
                              more validated than one in phase 1. It would have a bigger impact on valuation than a program in 
                              phase 1. If both these assumptions are true, then we can use the move in a company's stock price 
                              based on a clinical failure or success to inform us of the value.

                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              My model is a sum of the parts model. I take each drug in the pipeline and figure out what it could 
                              earn in revenues at peak sales. Then I adjust that value based on the level of validation of that drug. 
                              That gives me the value for that single drug. Then I add up all the value for all the programs and add 
                              in the cash. If I have a drug worth $500 million value, a second worth $250 million, and the company 
                              has $500 million cash, my valuation would be $500 million + $250 million + $500 million = $1.25 billion 
                              value.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The key values here are estimating peak sales and adjusting those sales based on the level of clinical 
                              validation. You can often get estimates for sales from analysts or even the company. The harder way is 
                              more accurate, but takes more time. If you follow your companies, they will often define for you the 
                              size of the patient population in their presentations. Then all you need to do is find prices of 
                              comparable drugs, and you can calculate peak sales. The only change would be to adjust for potential 
                              market share for competition. The level of validation for the drug would simply be the level of 
                              clinical success it has achieved. I take the peak sales and adjust them for the phase of development 
                              using .1x for preclinical, 1x for phase 1 data, 2x for phase 2 data, 3x for phase 3 data and 5x sales 
                              for a mature biotech valuation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once you have the value for each drug in the pipeline, you just add them up and add in the cash on the 
                              balance sheet. This will give you a total valuation for the company. You can compare the market cap 
                              you calculated to the current market cap to see if it is too expensive or too cheap. You can even 
                              adjust your valuation based on the outstanding shares and get a stock price for that valuation. Every 
                              time a company reports they will issue a 10Q or 10K. The very first page will list the number of 
                              outstanding shares at the time of reporting. You can divide your valuation by the shares outstanding 
                              and get a price target.
