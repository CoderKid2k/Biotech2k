                    <section>
                         <p> 
                              I have gone through a few Fintech courses. They all go over all the technologies and how they 
                              work in the space of finance. These are things like electronic payments, mobile wallets, online 
                              banking, online investing, robo advisors and cryptocurrencies. I want to cover this topic not by 
                              going over endless amounts of technology that really doesn't help. I want to cover the applications
                              and services that work in these areas and how they can help you. I am sure most of us have used the traditional 
                              banking system. We all have a local bank with a checking account. Maybe even a savings account. We probably 
                              have a debit card and even a credit card. Most of us probably access those services by online applications.
                              We have used financial technology to some point. Here I just want to cover some of the services people might 
                              not be aware of that could help them in their journey of personal finance and investing.

                         <p> 
                              Mobile Wallets are a digital form of the traditional wallet where you would put your paper currencies. Digital 
                              wallets can offer many new applications. You can use them to pay for things online, you can use them to pay you 
                              friends or family. Many of these digital wallet services offer more applications than just a wallet. I am going to 
                              cover Paypal, Cash App and Venmo under this category. You typically set up these accounts online and/or on a phone.
                              Some of them allow you to use them in both devices. You set up the accounts and link them to a bank account through 
                              the Automated Clearing House &#40;ACH&#41; system using a service like Plaid. Paypal lets you link credit cards to your account to use 
                              for payment methods for online shopping. Once linked to a bank account, you can deposit money into and out of these 
                              applications. You can also set up a direct deposit to these types of applications. I don't think I ever would as they 
                              are too limited in function compared to online banking, but that is up to each user. You can use all 
                              these applications to send money to and from friends. The one thing you can't do with 
                              them is use them as a bank for other applications. You can't link them through ACH to your Binance or Robinhood account. 
                              You can get a debit card with these applications which can allow you to use them at a store or online to make purchases.
                              Here I will look deeper at each of these applications and their pros and cons.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              Paypal is the oldest of the mobile wallets applications. It has been around since 1998. I have personally used it 
                              for over a decade so it gets my highest level of trust. I love that they allow you to link a bank account and credit 
                              card. You can use it for checkout on many online websites. I probably have at least 10 monthly subscriptions paid 
                              through Paypal. I love that only 1 company gets all my credit card info. Then I just choose checkout with Paypal at
                              any website. They offer a debit card and a credit card if you choose to apply for them. They offer a savings program
                              through their application that works like a savings account. It tends to have higher interest rates than the national
                              average. You can use it to send and receive money with friends and family. It even offers some crypto currencies you can 
                              buy and hold. They offer Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. You can use the debit or credit 
                              card at any physical stores or shops to make payments. I find it very useful
                              and it is the one application I actually use. They don't offer any checking accounts which is similar to all mobile 
                              wallet applications. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Cash App is one that I use with friends and family to send money back and forth. I personally would not use it if it were not 
                              for them. I see a ton of risk in this application with the amount of scammers on social media with this application. 
                              They had some functions I liked, but there are other services I found that could offer all the same things but without the 
                              risk. I think it works if you make sure you only use it with people you know and trust. 
                              It offers a cash account where you can link your bank account. You can deposit money and use it with a debit card. You have 
                              to apply for their debit card if you want one. This offers you the ability to put in money and send it to friends or family. 
                              You can use the debit card for making purchases online and in stores. They offer a savings account with a good interest 
                              rate. I have never seen any checkout with Cash App options on any website. The only cryptocurrency they offer is Bitcoin. They 
                              do offer buying stocks, but they are limited with the companies they offer. I only found about half of the companies I follow 
                              on their application. They don't offer a credit card like Paypal. I found it had a little bit of everything, but not enough of 
                              the specific things to warrant use. There are better apps for mobile wallets. There are better apps for cryptocurrencies. There 
                              are better apps for mobile investing. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Venmo offers a social media component to its application. This allows you to import friends and family to send 
                              money back and forth. You can post your spending and sending money along with cool emojis. You can link your 
                              bank account to Venmo through the ACH network and make deposits. They also
                              offer you a debit card if you apply for it. This will allow you to use it online and in stores to make purchases. 
                              They don't offer a credit card. Only Paypal offered the option for 
                              getting a credit card of the 3 mobile wallet applications.  I did not see a savings account option with them. They do offer some 
                              cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. I haven't seen any online sites yet that offer a 
                              Venmo checkout. I know they are now owned by Paypal, but I can't find any reason to use this over Paypal itself. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is just my review of the mobile wallets applications. If you already use an online banking or investing app, you 
                              may find you don't have any need for these types of applications. Most people seem to use them among close friends and 
                              family they trust. Personally, Paypal is the only one I actually find a use for as I can deposit money into 
                              Paypal and use it like a savings account for things I want to buy like a new laptop. Once I have enough cash in there, I 
                              can use the debit card to make my purchase. I also use a linked credit card to do the vast majority of my online 
                              shopping. If you use Apple Pay or Google pay, you probably don't need these applications unless you are sending money 
                              to friends and family.

                         <h2 class="section-title" id="mobilebanking">Mobile Banking</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Most of us probably use mobile banking already. We probably have a bank with an online banking app that 
                              allows us to do most of our banking needs right on our cell phone. We all have a brick and mortar bank which 
                              is probably located near where we live and we use a combination of in bank and online services. What does fintech 
                              have to offer in the space of banking that might be of interest to us? Some banks save cost by not having 
                              brick and mortar banks. They exist only online. They use partner banks to store deposits for customers so they 
                              are FDIC insured. They have no employees since they exist only online. This allows them to offer some very attractive 
                              rates for customers along with many other services that some normal banks might now offer. They can offer higher 
                              interest on accounts along with things like crypto and stock investing. Some of them are designed well to work 
                              with other online applications for payments and investing which make them very convenient. 
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              The first one here is Sofi. They offer all the standard banking options with checking and savings accounts. You 
                              can even order a paper checkbook if you want one. They have a debit card you can link to the checking account. They 
                              offer a credit card and other loans and banking services. They even offer investing with crypto and stocks. 
                              They pretty much cover everything you would want from a bank. They allow direct deposit if you want to use them
                              as your primary bank. They have both a website and phone app for the best of both uses. I use both of these services.
                              They have tools built in for tracking spending and helping with budgeting. They even offer your FICO credit score 
                              from one of the major rating agencies. I haven't been using them long, but I 
                              haven't found anything I dislike about them. They seem to have it all, and it is in a very nice and easy to use 
                              application. The one drawback is they are only located in the US. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Chime is the other great alternative. They offer all the same services with a checking and savings account. 
                              They offer both a debit and credit card. They have a credit builder option that is designed to help build your credit 
                              score. They have a credit score tracker which I think uses the Advantage score. They offer the bonus of being international
                              for those who might want to use them outside the US. The one thing they lack is the investing part of the application. If 
                              you are not looking to invest or buy crypto, this is a very attractive online banking option. Some of their banking 
                              services are nicer than Sofi, but they are more focused strictly on banking. The one thing I disliked about Chime is it 
                              tends to have a lot of limits on functions like daily deposits or withdrawals. That kind of makes it too limited for me 
                              personally. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The system I use to maximize online banks is to use it like a gateway to the digital financial life. I have a local bank 
                              where I have my checking with a paper checkbook in case I should need it. I have my Emergency savings account with them 
                              in case I have an emergency. I linked that account to my Sofi account. I push all my money from there to Sofi where I use it 
                              to spend and invest online with other online applications. It acts like a firewall so that no one knows or can access my 
                              local bank account. It is only linked to Sofi. If you are doing banking and investing online, looking at one of these 
                              Fintech banks could help boost your interest that you get over a standard account as many of these checking and savings accounts 
                              pay high interest rates compared to normal banks.
