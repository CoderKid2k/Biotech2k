                    <section>
                         <p> 
                              I have gone through a few Fintech courses. They all go over all the technologies and how they 
                              work in the space of finance. These are things like electronic payments, moblie wallets, online 
                              banking, online investing, robo advisors and cryptocurrencies. I want to cover this topic not by 
                              going over endless amounts of technology that really doesn't help. I want to cover the applications
                              and services that work in these area and how they can help you. I am sure most of us have use the traditional 
                              banking system. We all have a local bank with a checking account. Maybe even a savings accout. We probably 
                              have a debit card and even a credit card. Most of us probably access those services by online applications.
                              We have used financial technology to some point. Here I just want to cover some of the services people might 
                              not be aware of that could help them in their journey of personal finance and investing.

                         <p> 
                              Mobile Wallets are a digital form of the traditional wallet where you would put your paper currencies. Digital 
                              wallets can offer many new applications. You can use them to pay for things online, you can use them to pay you 
                              friends or family. Many of these digital wallet services offer more applications than just a wallet. I am going to 
                              cover Paypal, Cash App and Venmo under this category. You typically set up these accounts online and/or on a phone.
                              Some of them allow you to use them in both devices. You set up the accounts and link them to a bank account through 
                              the Automatied Clearning House &#40;ACH&#41; system using a service like Plaid. Paypal lets you link credit cards to your account to use 
                              for payment methods for online shopping. Once linked to a bank account, you can deposit money into and out of these 
                              applications. You can also set up a direct deposit to these types of applications. I don't think I ever would as they 
                              are too limited in function compared to online banking, but that is up to each user. You can use all 
                              these applications to send money to and from friends. The one thing you can't do with 
                              them is use them as a bank for other application. You can't link them through ACH to your Binance or Robinhood account. 
                              You can get a debit card with these applications which can allow you to use them at a store or online to make purchases.
                              Here I will look deeper at each of these applications and their pros and cons.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              Paypal is the oldest of the mobile wallets applications. It has been around since 1998. I have personally used it 
                              for over a decade so it gets my higest level of trust. I love that they allow you to link a bank account and credit 
                              card. You can use it for checkout on many online websites. I probably have at least 10 monthly subscriptions paid 
                              through Paypal. I love that only 1 company gets all my credit card info. Then I just choose checkout with Paypal at
                              any website. They offer a debit card and a credit card if you chose to apply for them. They offer a savings program
                              through their application that works like a savings account. It tends to have a higer interest rate that the national
                              average. You can use it to send and recieve money with friends and family. It even offers some crypto currencies you can 
                              buy and hold. They offer Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. You can use the debit or credit 
                              card at any physical stores or shops to make payments. I find it very useful
                              and it is the one application I actually use. They don't offer any checking accounts which is similar to all mobile 
                              wallet applications. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Cash App is one that I use with friends and family to send money back and forth. I personally would not use it if it were not 
                              for them. I see a ton of risk in this application with the amount of scammers on social media with this application. 
                              They had some functions I liked, but there are other services I found that could offer all the same things but without the 
                              risk. I think it works if you make sure you only use it with people you know and trust. 
                              It offers a cash account where you can link your bank account. You can deposit money and use it with a debit card. You have 
                              to apply for their debit card if you want one. This offers you the ability to put in money and send it to friends or family. 
                              You can use the debit card for making purchases online and in stores. They offer a savings account with a good interest 
                              rate. I never seen any checkout with Cash App options on any website. The only cryptocurrency they offer is Bitcoin. They 
                              do offer buying stocks, but they are limited with the companies they offer. I only found about half of the companies I follow 
                              on their application. They don't offer a credit card like Paypal. I found it had a little bit of everything, but not enough of 
                              the specific things to warrant use. There are better apps for mobile wallets. There are better apps for cryptocurrencies. There 
                              are better apps for mobile investing. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Venmo offers a social media component to is application. This allows you to import friends and family to send 
                              money back and forth. You can post your spending and sending money along with cool emojis. You can link your 
                              bank account to Venmo through the ACH network and make deposits. They also
                              offer you a debt card if you apply for it. This will allow you to use it online and in stores to make purchases. 
                              They don't offer a credit card. Only Paypal offered the option for 
                              getting a credit card of the 3 mobile wallet applications.  I did not see a savings account option with them. They do offer some 
                              cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. I haven't seen any online sites yet that offer a 
                              Venmo checkout. I know they are now owned by Paypal, but I can't find any reason to use this over Paypal itself. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is just my review of the moblie wallets applications. If you already use an online banking or investing app, you 
                              may find you don't have any need for these types of applications. Most people seem to use them amoung close friends and 
                              family of people they trust. Personally, Paypal is the only one I actually find a use for as I can deposit money into 
                              Paypal and use it like a savings account for things I want to buy like a new laptop. Once I have enough cash in there, I 
                              can use the debit card to make my purchase. I also use a linked credit card to do the vast majority of my online 
                              shopping. If you use Apple Pay or Google pay, you probably don't need these applications unless you are sending money 
                              to friends and family.
