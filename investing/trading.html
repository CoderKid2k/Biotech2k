                         <p> 
                              My system for trading around my core position is a simple one. I will accumulate half of my position
                              for my core holding. Then I will trade around that core position by buying shares into sell offs. Then
                              I sell some of those shares into the big rallies. I tend to use 20% as my rule. If a stock pulls back 20%,
                              I will add a little for trading shares. I will keep adding some each 20% it pulls back until it bottoms, 
                              or I have reached my max position size. When the stock goes back up, I will sell a little each time it goes 
                              up 20% until I have reached my minimum core position. I will not sell my core position unless I think the 
                              company is fundamentally broken. Then I will sell everything. 
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              If the stock hits new highs, I will wait for at least a 20% pull back from that high before I even consider 
                              buying some trading shares. Stocks in biotech can have very wild swings. We all just witnessed this in 2021 and 
                              2022. We saw biotech stocks lose 70% or more of their value. That is a huge swing that could be hundreds of 
                              percent for the investor who buys low and fades the next bull market. Just in the 2020 crash from covid, many 
                              biotech stock rallied between 300% and 800% from the bottom of 2020 to the top of 2021. When I think the market 
                              is extremely bubbly, I will even sell most if not everything and wait. I hit 100% cash in July of 2015 before 
                              the 2015 and 2016 bear market related to the pricing debate. I hit 90% cash in January of 2021. I think my biggest 
                              regret was starting to nibble back stocks too soon. I waited a good 20% to 30% off the top of the biotech top, 
                              but it turned out to be way too soon.

                              My style tends to embrace what I find to be the best of both Investing and Trading. For me, it keeps me 
                              active and engaged with investing. Its also allows me to make short term money while
                              making long term investments. I like to use trading around my core position to use capital gains to pay down
                              my cost basis. I will track my capital gains and subtract them from my cost bais. Once my cost gets to $0, I 
                              have paid for my core position. Its now on the house's money. I can hold it for ever, and it doesn't cost 
                              me a thing.
