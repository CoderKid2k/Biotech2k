                         <h2 class="investing-headers">Fundamental Analysis</h2>
                         <p> 
                              I have always been a fundamental and value investor. I solely focus on picking companies. 
                              I don't care about charts, and I really don't care about the overall economy. The economy goes 
                              through its up cycles and it goes through its down cycles. The up cycles are good for taking profits and the down cycles 
                              are good for accumulating. I focus on the companies. I focus on the fundamentals and the value as they tell me the 
                              2 most important things about a company. The fundamentals tell we what I should buy. Fundamentals is about the
                              quality of the company. I also focus on the value of the company. Value tells me when I should buy a company.
                              Companies go from expensive to cheap as the economy goes through its cycles. I learn to sell some on the up cycle
                              and buy it back on the down cycle. When it comes to fundamentals, I tend to focus on two key aspects of companies that I feel
                              are the magic formula to success. They are Management and Science. 
                         </p>                   
                    </section>
               
                    <section>
                         <h2 class="investing-headers">Management</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Great management can turn even average science into a successful company. Bad management can wreck even 
                              the best science.  I would never own a company with what I perceive to be weak management. When I look 
                              at a company's  management, I really look at the CEO. They are the captain of the ship and ultimately 
                              all decisions go through them. I like to evaluate a company's management over time. It really takes time 
                              to figure out if management knows what they are talking about, and if they are living up to their promises.
                         </p>
                         <p>      
                              I like to go over at least a year's worth of conferences, webcasts and earnings calls.  I take notes on 
                              what was promised, like drug development timelines, and then I check off the promises delivered and circle 
                              those that are not. If they miss a deadline, and they provide good reason for it, I will let it go. I know
                              Covid had delayed many company's deadlines. I don't expect perfection. I expect consistency. As long as 
                              there is not a habbit of dropping the ball. I like to follow a company for a few months and listen to 
                              conferences in real time before I make any commitment to buy. Then I start slowly with a small position and 
                              only add when I think the company is impressing me with the results like data or events. Its like any other 
                              relationship. I got to take the time to get to know the company and trust the management before I commit 
                              my hard earned money to them.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A great CEO will be honest and have integrity. They are straight shooters. They are going to tell you what 
                              they expect and admit when the results don't match up to it.  A weak CEO will try to explain away bad data 
                              or try to spin bad data as if it were good data. Those are the ones you have to be aware of. A great CEO 
                              just lets the data speak for itself, and tells the truth. A great CEO is also a great communicator. They 
                              go to various conferences and love to talk about their company. They also have to be able to communicate 
                              well. You want to see the CEO be able to handle the tough questions with grace and ease. What I don't want to 
                              see is a CEO who is a hyping or pumping the science or company. They tend to be worst with throwing around flashy 
                              buzz words just to crush investors when it all fails.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              A great CEO must be a good financial manager. Managing 
                              cash balance is key in the biotech market where a stock can go through long periods of "out of favor".  I 
                              like to see at least 2 years of cash on the balance sheet to get through the lean times. It is also 
                              important for a CEO to time the secondaries when they will be best received. I like to see them take 
                              advantage of investor optimism and sell into the big rallies off good data or just market excitement. Another 
                              major aspect of good financial management is not recklessly spending money. I see some companies that have 
                              just so much going on that they burn huge amounts of cash. They become giant money pits. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              A great CEO needs 
                              to navigate the regulatory process very well.  I see it too often where an inexperienced CEO makes tons of 
                              blunders with trial design, regulatory submission, manufacturing inspections and communicating with the 
                              FDA. This leads to delays in timing of trials, clinical holds, Complete Response Letters (CRL's) or even bad 
                              trial outcomes. It can be hard to know if a CEO is one of these rookies, but it usually shows up quickly in 
                              the data. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The 
                              last and most important attribute of a CEO for me is visionary. A great CEO has to make great decisions 
                              around company development. They have a vision about their company and where they want it to go. They make 
                              great decisions to develop the long term story. They make good partnerships where needed. They make good 
                              decisions about which indications to pursue first. Some CEO's lack decision making and spend a huge amount 
                              of money trying to chase everything at once. A good leader will pick a few key programs and pursue them to 
                              commercial before spending more money. A good leader won't always be perfect so I don't sell on just one 
                              bad event like a trial failure or a delay with a trial. If it becomes a habit by happening more than once, 
                              then that is an alarm the CEO might not be up to the task. I personally think that management makes up about 
                              70% of the value of a company.
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="investing-headers">Science</h2>
                         <p> 
                              The quality of the science is the other part of the magic formula for a winning company. I look for a 
                              technology platform that can yield many new drugs. I also like companies focused on mastering one 
                              science. Some companies look like a swap meet of different sciences. They tend to be a Jack of all Trades, 
                              but a master of none. Here are some attributes that I look for in a companies science and pipeline.
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              When it comes to science, there is never a lack of great companies out there who are innovating. What I 
                              focus on is getting the best bang for my buck when it comes to picking science. It all comes down to picking 
                              the science that has the largest overall potential. If 2 companies have great science, which one has the 
                              biggest potential? One might have an innovative drug, but it only applies to a few hundred patients. The other
                              might be just as innovative but help millions of patients. When investing in companies, I want to pick those 
                              who have innovation, but also the largest potentail. That means great companies have more than one drug 
                              in the pipeline. I don't want any one hit wonders. They tend to be 
                              too volatile and way too binary. They are either huge wins or massive losses. They can be gut wrenching.
                              I want a technology platform that can yield many successful drugs. Those are the big winners when their 
                              technology works out. They can keep following up one success after another.
                         </p>      
                         <p>
                              I like to look for companies that have science that separates them from the rest of the pack. You want a 
                              competitive advantage in any business and game changing science is one such method. I want superior 
                              science compared to peers, or I want a company with no competition in a new area of science. I tend to 
                              focus on picking areas of science that are leading the technology in the industry. This means I am betting on 
                              my ability to pick out innovative new science. I got to assume I will be wrong on a lot of these companies as 
                              they are so speculative and early stage. I manage this using strategy. I pick a basket of companies in a new 
                              innovative space and place small bets on each. Then I monitor them as they advance the science. I use the data 
                              to weed out the weak companies and buy more of the winners. I reward success and don't reward failure. Eventually, 
                              I will jettison the losers when the markets are back in bull market mode, and I can sell them for the best prices.
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              When evaluating companies as the data comes in, I don't dump a company if they have a failure early on. 
                              Too many times, I have seen a company fail once just to make a masive comeback. Failure is part of the game 
                              for early stage biotech. What I don't want to see is a pattern of failure. If I have a company that has a big 
                              clinical setback, I put them on probation until they get another data readout. Good data forgives the older 
                              failure, but another failure confirms it. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The final aspect is I focus on key areas of science. Biotech is a big space. There is a lot of science across 
                              so many areas of the science. I find I do better when I pick a few key areas to focus on. Sure, I might miss a 
                              great company that develops a good new Alzheimer's drug. That is fine because my focus allows me to be an expert 
                              in the areas I focus on. I have more success when I focus. I use to cover anything biotech, but I found that I 
                              was hindered by areas of science where I did not have the expertise to keep up. That is when I switched to focus 
                              on key science themes for me. I focus on Genetics, Immunology, Hematology and Oncology. They are all extremely
                              complementary to each other. Oncology actually requires a mastery of Genetics and Immunology. 
                         </p>
