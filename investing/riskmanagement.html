                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="understand">Understanding Risk</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Risk is the possibility of losing money in an investment. We can manage risk in our investments once 
                              we understand what it is and what kinds of risk there is around investing. Often just understanding 
                              the risks helps people better understand how they want to invest. I always use the expression of, 
                              “Manage the risks, and the rewards will take care of themselves”. I think I adapted this from 
                              something Warren Buffet once said. No truer words have been spoken. You can't make money unless you 
                              understand all the risks and how to mitigate them. You can't make money if you lose everything in 
                              one very speculative investment that fails.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              How much risk you are willing to take comes down to two factors. The first is your personal tolerance 
                              for risk. Some people, like me, can put all their money in a bunch of risky speculative biotech 
                              companies and sleep like a baby. Other people get all nervous and can't sleep a wink if their 
                              portfolio goes even slightly into the red. I know a lot of people who say they can tolerate a ton 
                              of risk, but they freak out whenever something goes wrong with any of their companies. You have to 
                              honestly know how much risk you are comfortable with.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              You should never take any more risk than is necessary to achieve your long term goals. The market 
                              averages 8% a year over the long term. If you need more than that to reach your retirement goals, 
                              then you might need more risk. If you don't, then you can safely put your money into a low cost index 
                              fund and kick back. The amount of risk you want to assume depends on how much risk you can tolerate 
                              and how much risk you need to assume to meet your goals. I honestly believe that 90% of investors could 
                              contribute to a low cost index fund each pay day using a tax free account and do well over the long 
                              term.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The further you go out the risk spectrum while investing the bigger the reward, but so is the bigger 
                              risk of losing all your money. I see so many investors focus only on the rewards and never the risks. 
                              Each asset class has a different risk and reward level. Bonds typically have lower return rates around 
                              5% to 6% while having a lower risk. They will rarely move more than 10% in a year from highs to lows. 
                              Stocks will average 8% to 10% on average, but can swing more than 20% up or down in a single year. 
                              Asset allocation is a key principle of designing a portfolio to meet the highest possible return for 
                              the lowest possible risk an individual investor wants to assume. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are different kinds of risks an investor will face while investing. Market risk always exists. 
                              This is the risk of the overall market having a crash or correction. Corrections and crashes happen 
                              all the time in the market. They can come from economic forces like a recession or geopolitical forces 
                              like an earthquake, pandemic or war. You can't control the events that cause market risk, and you 
                              don't know when they are going to strike. In the market we call them the Black Swan events. There are 
                              two main ways to protect yourself from the overall market risk. The first is you can hedge yourself. 
                              I have friends that sell covered calls or other options strategies to protect their investment in 
                              stocks from market risk. They earn extra money selling these calls when stocks are flat to going lower 
                              as the calls never get triggered. They take their own risk as a spike in the stock or market could end 
                              up with you getting “called” out of your stock, limiting your upside. The other is just to raise cash 
                              into big rallies for the market and buy back positions into the big crash or correction. That is my 
                              strategy. I tend to fade the rallies slowly as the stocks move higher. Then I slowly buy back my 
                              positions into a sell-off. I never go below a minimum position and never over a maximum position.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The other major risk is company specific risks. Anyone who has been in biotech for 5 seconds knows these 
                              all too well. They often come in the form of clinical failures, but there are many types of company 
                              risks. The biggest one is the risk of a poor management team. A poor management team can turn your 
                              investment life into a humbling experience. Taking a discovery stage biotech from start to commercial 
                              takes many important skills for a management team. Many of them are not up to that task. There are 
                              risks of patents, competition, obsolescence, failure to find funding, manufacturing and so many more.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="mitigate">Risk Mitigation Strategies</h2>
                         <p> 
                              The first thing new investors in biotech should figure out is what you are 
                              willing to lose. With a sector where 90% of the science fails, you have to have a high pain 
                              tolerance or a very good strategy. We will go with strategy because no one wants to endure a lot 
                              of pain. When it comes to science, we go through a lot of failures before we find great success. 
                              Hopefully, most of that is done in the early discovery phase before it comes into the clinical 
                              stage. Even so, many drugs still fail to ever reach commercial sales. We will look at strategies 
                              to limit the damage any single company can do while maximizing the returns each company can give 
                              us. For me, that level is 5%. I will risk up to 5% of my money on a speculative company. If I 
                              take that kind of loss, I know I can make up for it.

                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              Diversification is the best strategy for protecting yourself from single company risk. If you are 
                              diversified enough, it can also protect yourself from overall market risk as assets like bonds do well 
                              in bad markets while stocks do well in good markets and real estate does well with inflation. 
                              Spreading out your money is the best lesson any successful investor learns. Nothing is worse than 
                              going all in on a single company or asset and it fails miserably. You will always hear about that one 
                              guy who got rich going all in on a company, and it was a huge winner. What you never hear about is 
                              the 100 other people who go bankrupt from going all in on a company that fails. People who had all 
                              their money in companies like Enron and Worldcom know this lesson all too well. The first thing I 
                              recommend for new investors is figure out how much they can afford to lose in a single company. That 
                              becomes the limit they should use to put into any one company. I usually will go between 10 and 20 
                              companies depending on how much I want to risk in each. If you have 10 companies, that would limit 
                              each one to 10%. At 20 companies, that would limit each to 5%. How much money you concentrate in each 
                              company depends on how risky it is and how much risk tolerance you have.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some investors tend to put more into the companies that have big gains while limiting the newer 
                              companies that lack any real gains. Spreading out your money into more companies is the best way 
                              to protect it if one of those companies turns out to be the next Theranos. By setting a max limit 
                              on each company, it will protect you in case something goes wrong. I always tell myself, “If I am 
                              right about this company, it will come back”. Never throw good money after bad into an investment 
                              that isn’t doing well. A max limit position prevents the desire to double down on bad companies.  
                              It is natural for an investor to dig in and insist they are right about a company. They will continue 
                              to throw good money after bad into a company as the stock goes lower. All they end up doing is 
                              amplifying the losses on a bad investment. Do not ever get into the habit of selling the winners to 
                              fund the losers. You end up with a portfolio full of tragedy. Setting a maximum limit on any 
                              position should be done even before you make the first buy. Once you have done all your research, 
                              you know how risky it is and how it fits into your overall strategy. Set those limits right away and 
                              stick to them.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Another good rule is don't buy all of your position at one time. In this day and age, you can trade for 
                              free at most brokers. There is no reason to be a hero and go all in with your max position right away. 
                              I usually make one buy early with a small position to get me in on the story. Then I wait for a 
                              correction in the stock to
                              build up my position. If you love the company now, you will really love it at a much cheaper price. Too 
                              many people go all in for their position right away. That is a very risky strategy as we often let 
                              emotion control our buying. We tend to chase stocks as they go higher because we want to get rich 
                              quick, and we panic sell them as they go lower because we can’t stand the pain. Emotion is the challenge 
                              of a good investor. By nibbling away at a position over time, you can eliminate the emotions and make 
                              it a process.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The best investment in the world is the risk free investment. This comes by taking enough profits in a 
                              company to take out your costs. Then you can keep it forever if you want. I call this playing with the 
                              house's money. I get that question the most of any question I get from investors. It goes like this, “I 
                              bought XYZ company and it's up 300%, should I keep it or sell it?” My answer is always the same. I tell 
                              them to sell at least enough to take out their costs. Then they can let the rest run as long as they 
                              like the company. This allows us to take out our cost when things are bubbly so we don't lose money 
                              during the bust period. The one thing you can count on in biotech is there will be setbacks and 
                              struggles for every early stage company. Taking out your cost reduces your risk to zero. I tend to use 
                              a system of trading around my position to pay off my cost a little at a time. Once I reduce my cost 
                              basis to zero from capital gains, I can hold my shares at no risk to me. The biggest risk I have ever 
                              found in the markets is emotion. Things like fear and greed compel investors to do all the wrong things 
                              for all the wrong reasons and at the very worst time. Things like buying an exciting new biotech at the 
                              peak of euphoria right before it crashes back to reality. Fear will compel investors to sell a great 
                              company just because the stock is going lower right before a big buyout. The first thing a successful 
                              investor learns to do is to control their emotions with strategy and discipline.
