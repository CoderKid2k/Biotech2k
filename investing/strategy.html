                         <p> 
                              I started in 1996 and have been actively investing for 27 years. I have been retired since 2000 and 
                              doing investing as a hobby. I have a small biotech portfolio I started back in 2011 that I use for playing 
                              biotech stocks. I typically have between 10 and 20 companies in my portfolio. Right now, I think it 
                              is well over 30. That is because the market has been in such a huge bear market for biotech
                              that I have been buying everything I can. I don't like to put too much in any one company as biotech is
                              very speculative, and the statistics show that 90% of these early stage companies fail. I usually don't 
                              put more than 3% to 5% in any single company. At least not early on. 
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              I like to play baskets of companies based on key science concepts. I start with a concept like 
                              Techbio, CRISPR, Synthetic Biology and iPSC. Then I assess every company in that space until I find 
                              all the top companies I like. I will build a basket of those companies. I typically have 3 to 5 
                              science themes and each theme has a max cap of 20% of my portfolio. I will usually have 3 to 5 companies 
                              in each themes. Less than 2 companies and its not a theme. More than 5 has to be narrowed down to the 
                              best of the best. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I never risk more than 3% to 5% of my money in any single company. That means I will only exceed that limit
                              if I have enough capital gains to reduce my cost basis. For example, if I had gains that equal 2% of total 
                              portfolio in a company, I would be willing to own up to 7% of my total in that company because only 5% of 
                              that would be my money. The rest is already paid for. Most of the time, I am cutting companies out that did 
                              not live up to expections while building positions into new companies into market corrections.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I never buy all my stock in a company at one time. I tend to like to nibble away at it as it comes down in 
                              price. With today's free trading at most brokers, there is no reason to buy a ton of stock at one time unless 
                              you think you can predict the market. Once I have built my position in a company, I tend to trade around that 
                              position taking profits when the markets are up and buying some back when the markets are down. I tend to use 
                              20% as a rule for buying or selling on stock moves, but not always. I like to watch the market sentiment to see 
                              when things are over loved or over hated. I never sell my core shares in a company unless I think it has become 
                              fundamentally broken. I try to keep half of my position as my core position and use half for trading around 
                              my position into the market swings. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I find this strategy works best for me as it gives me the best of long term investing and the best of short 
                              term trading. It keeps me active enough that I don't get bored and quit, but also focused on the long term so 
                              I don't miss the bigger picture. This is just my strategy.
                         </p>
