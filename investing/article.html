                         <p>March 5, 2023 by <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneInvesting" target="_blank">@GeneInvesting</a></p><p>
                              Many ask me why I like gene editing, and more specifically, <a href="../companies/beam.html">BEAM</a> and
                              <a href="../companies/intellia.html">NTLA</a> so much. First I'll answer this 
                              question more broadly. I truly believe CRISPR and gene editing are the biggest discoveries in human 
                              history. Simply looking at the fact a new “copycat” company pops up every other month tells you there 
                              must be tremendous value in this space. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              Cathie Wood gets a lot of flak for pumping some questionable stocks- she is human and no one is right 
                              100% of the time- but she had a good point a few years ago. We can put value on a new tech breakthrough 
                              like the iPod or iPhone, but what is it worth to cure a blind child?
                              Companies like <a href="../companies/crispr.html">CRSP</a>, NTLA, and BEAM are about to introduce themselves to the world as the curers of 
                              serious diseases. Patient testimonials are already being published that speak to the life-changing gift 
                              these medicines are providing. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              But why am I oddly so comfortable being invested in such a risky space? Looking at NTLA, I believe it 
                              has been largely de-risked at this point. Some patients in the 2001-PN trial were dosed over 2 years 
                              ago. They've dosed over 50 with their 2 lead in-vivo medicines already.
                              Taking a look at the CRSP success also should help ease some concerns, however ex-vivo is largely less 
                              “dangerous.” CRSP has some patients who are still essentially cured after receiving their treatment 4 
                              years ago.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Also the nice thing about NTLA is the fact their 2 lead programs are nearly identical. The success and 
                              safety of 1 largely can be used to bolster the probability of success of the other.
                              I truly believe there are few stocks positioned as well for the next 4-5 years as they are. Add in the 
                              fact their CEO appears to be firing on all cylinders- everything they do is incredibly quick. 
                              So why BEAM? They appear the exact opposite so far- incredibly slow. Their tech is superior and they 
                              have the largest toolbox out of all the companies. They even have access to certain parts of prime 
                              editing. Base editing, when perfected, is better and safer than 1.0 CRISPR.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              BEAM can tackle many more diseases and I foresee bigger upside in the long run for this company. Their 
                              ESCAPE technology is exciting and puts them in the lead to cure sickle cell disease on a worldwide 
                              level.
                              I for one, do not expect the biggest bull-run for this exciting technology to have already happened. If 
                              you think it got out of hand before (which it totally did) just wait until we start parading cured 
                              patients out on CNBC to talk to Jim Cramer and the Fast Money crew!

                         <p>March 1, 2023 by <a href="https://twitter.com/Biotech2k1" target="_blank">@biotech2k1</a></p>
                         <p>
                              I have heard many people try to call this crash in biotech the end of the Biotechnology sector. 
                              A sector that has been around for decades. One of the most necessary sectors in the entire 
                              market. Here I am going to lay out for you the opposite case. I have been investing in tech and 
                              biotech for 27 years. I have seen so much technology that excites me about the future, and I see 
                              it today.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The biggest question I always get in biotech investing is when will we run out of things to 
                              discover or great new technologies to invent. My response is we will never run out until we cure 
                              every disease. We are entering a very exciting new era in biotechnology where we have new tools that 
                              could completely redefine the future. People who listen to those naysayers could be missing the best 
                              opportunity of their lifetimes. I actually have more excitement and investment ideas today than I ever 
                              had in my 27 years of investing. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              New technologies like using AI or Machine Learning to make new 
                              connections in biology or genetics could revolutionize how we approach drug discovery. Automation can 
                              reduce workloads and simplify redundant processes to bring down costs of drug discovery. We have come to 
                              call this space of biotech the TechBio space. This is just beginning to get started. Right now everyone 
                              is skeptical of this space. I think in 10 years, any company that did not embrace these technologies 
                              will fade away into the history books of time. There are going to be new leaders in this space that 
                              emerge to become tomorrow's Google or Amazon. We can find them today for a mere fraction of what they 
                              could be tomorrow. Most of these companies are selling near their levels of cash. The discovery of new 
                              technology will always get funding by the visionary few. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The next space of excitement is Gene Editing 
                              tools like CRISPR. These tools are in their infancy and will continue to evolve as bright minds continue 
                              to find new ways to use them to do editing safer and easier. Barriers like delivery will be broken 
                              and there will be a revolution in fixing and removing Genetic Diseases from the human race. The 
                              companies that succeed here will be worth fortunes. The power of gene editing has given birth to Synthetic
                              Biology. This is the ability to take gene editing tools and use it to reprogram microbes to make them 
                              beneficial. We can reprogram pathogens to produce fertilizer or scrub carbon from the environment. The 
                              future ability of scientist to rewrite life on earth using gene editing can be exciting and terribly 
                              frighting. It is an awesome power and responsibility. There is going to be a need for Biosecurity to 
                              protect us from the ability of bad actors to misuse this technology.  Rewriting life won't just stop 
                              with microbes. We can use it to create human cells from stem cells. We have technologies like Induced 
                              Pluripotent Stem cells called iPSC that can allow us to reprogram human cells. We can create cell therapies 
                              to fight cancer. This is just getting started as we learn more about cell biology and 
                              human biology. I believe someday we will be able to grow entire organs from a single cell donation. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The 
                              last area will be the revolution of Sequencing. This has been a space of rapid evolution. We are still 
                              far from the ability to do end to end sequencing on every genome on earth for a very low cost. Someday, we 
                              will get our genome sequenced and we will know everything about ourselves. The risk and the benefits. We 
                              will be able to tailor medicine to the individual. Personalized medicine is only just beginning with 
                              cancer therapies. Someday we will know our risk long before it even becomes a disease. We will be focused 
                              more on prevention and correction before the disease occurs. Combining sequencing with other therapies 
                              like gene editing could allow sickness to be corrected before it happens. While many have taken to writing 
                              articles predicting the end of biotechnology, I have taken to the spreading of the Science Of The Future. 
                              I think scary sells a lot of articles, but vision will favor the patient investor.
