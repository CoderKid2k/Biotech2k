                              We start with some well known ones. These are in no particular order the ones I have chosen are because of service hidden fees, if they are FCA regulated and personal experience.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Etoro a good entry option it has copy trading and that means if you are a new trader you can copy 
                              successful traders, or if you are successful you can earn money from someone copying you it has low fees 
                              but no isa opportunity, it has Fx fees and inactivity fees that apply they are not too bad it isn't user 
                              friendly for beginners but offer ETFs and cryptocurrency they also do not allow transfer out of your 
                              portfolio.
                         </p>

                              Trading212 keeps funds with interactive brokers. There was a bit of a worry about a year ago when they 
                              stopped taking new customers about whether or not they would go bankrupt because they delayed reporting 
                              financials. They are using a free investing app and a website. You can buy fractional shares, and it is 
                              very good on the surface with basic indicators. They loan out your shares without giving customers any 
                              part of it. They make the bulk of their money from CFD which has a public health warning. They have Fx 
                              fees which are minimal but a high bid/ ask spread. They also charge if you don't use a bank transfer and 
                              deposit over 2k however they provide a free ISA option. They would be 1 of my top 3 if it wasn't for the 
                              fact from an issue I had with them where I reported them to the financial ombudsman, and it was upheld 
                              because of the fact I opened a formal complaint they permanently suspended my account and it took them 
                              6 months to sell my shares and then a further 3 months to process the funds.
                         </p>

                              Resolute an EU app. If you have a card, they get you into their ecosystem commission free and tiered 
                              trading however only 1500 stocks but does allow you to transfer out and a good exchange rate is one of 
                              the best.
                         </p>

                              Trade republic commission free up to 2% interest on cash deposit, 10,400 stocks and ETFs also allow 
                              transfer out.

                              Scalable Capital 2.3% interest on deposits and commission free trading in tiered plans free plan 
                              costs 99c a trade, 2.99 a month gives free trades, 4.99 gives free trades and 2.3% interest.

                         <p>
                              Degiro based in the Netherlands needs updating but allows transfer out. Degiro is actually free but 
                              you have to pay for each additional market, say the USA or EU 2.5 a year, and do not offer an ISA. 
                              Degiro charges 1.75 a trade. It has a Fx fee 0.25% over 20,000 shares but a good user interface 
                              with good research.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              Free Trade keeps adding more and more shares and improving the customer service has come along 
                              leaps and bounds as has the app. It has free and tiered levels which include 3% interest. You can 
                              have free monthly with zero commission, mid tier at 4.99 with an ISA, I use the highest tier which 
                              gives you USA stop losses and 3% interest on balances up to 2k on both GIA and ISA which covers the 
                              fee and allows you set prices to trigger sells/buy orders rather than playing the spread. On big 
                              orders, it pays for itself. Any issues they refunded my fees the Fx fee is 0.45%. They have over 
                              6000 shares and 600 funds, a good user interface and are constantly improving some shares behind a 
                              tier paywall they also provide a sipp option.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Bitpanda allows crypto as well as shares and commission free and no fees including no Fx fees.

                              Light Year commission free Fx fees were 0. If you spent under 3k a month now, they have implemented 
                              a 0.35% fee but waive it for new accounts for a set period. They also give news and updates and are 
                              upfront about fees. They give an interest rate of 3.75% for USA balances U.K., EU is a lot less. 
                              They have just over 3000 shares and could do with more but that will come when they have limit 
                              orders and stop losses as well as data analysis.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              Interactive Brokers one of the few that allow options trading and warrants and gives access to all 
                              OTC stocks. The rest have very little access to them. They have one of the lowest Fx fees as it is 
                              a set fee so the more you exchange the better. They also pay a percentage of the short exchange 
                              fee to investors, and it allows you to redeem SPACs whereas some of the others do not .
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              Hargreaves's Lansdown is the most pricy stockbroker on the list at 11.95 a trade but can reduce to 
                              5.95 if you make over 20 trades but if you are used to a platform like Barclays stockbrokers then 
                              this is a good alternative until you go free.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              AJ Bell costs 9.95 a trade so it's a no for me.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              InvestEngine is a commission free but etfs only, but you can buy vanguard funds cheaper than on 
                              vanguard. At the moment, it has over 400 funds. It has rebalancing, no fx fee and a good user 
                              interface.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              Stake is another that dropped out of my top 3 because it has commission free trading and no Fx fee 
                              when you deposit your pay, an exchange fee and your balance is kept in dollars which makes it good 
                              for us stocks. They have dividend stocks; however, they will be applying a small fee of £3 per 
                              trade.  They do split the si fee with you.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              Now I like the following in this order:
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Free Trade because I use the premium tier; however, if I didn’t, I may change my mind. They pay 
                              interest on deposits. For emergencies, as in a crash, they will pay the fees, and then you get t
                              railing stop loss and a lot of other features. Speaking to them, they informed me they are 
                              considering after hours trading
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              Light year because of the interest. I don’t like my emergency cash doing nothing so it is like it's 
                              earning me a dividend. They are early but use good data and give good updates and news. I would 
                              like more stocks on it however.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              IKBR because of the biggest number of shares available especially penny stocks ,warrants and 
                              options as well as si fee  the commissions are minimal.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              As I said stake and trading 212 would be in the list if it wasn’t for the commission coming to 
                              stake, and 212 experience I had. 
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              For ETFs InvestEngine it gives you a lot of information about the etf and holding. It could do with 
                              some more; however, it has enough and most on my list. It gives a good referral bonus &#40;although 
                              IKBR requires you to have a huge amount in their account&#41;.

                         <p>March 5, 2023 by <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneInvesting" target="_blank">@GeneInvesting</a></p><p>
                              Many ask me why I like gene editing, and more specifically, <a href="../companies/beam.html">BEAM</a> and
                              <a href="../companies/intellia.html">NTLA</a> so much. First I'll answer this 
                              question more broadly. I truly believe CRISPR and gene editing are the biggest discoveries in human 
                              history. Simply looking at the fact a new “copycat” company pops up every other month tells you there 
                              must be tremendous value in this space. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              Cathie Wood gets a lot of flak for pumping some questionable stocks- she is human and no one is right 
                              100% of the time- but she had a good point a few years ago. We can put value on a new tech breakthrough 
                              like the iPod or iPhone, but what is it worth to cure a blind child?
                              Companies like <a href="../companies/crispr.html">CRSP</a>, NTLA, and BEAM are about to introduce themselves to the world as the curers of 
                              serious diseases. Patient testimonials are already being published that speak to the life-changing gift 
                              these medicines are providing. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              But why am I oddly so comfortable being invested in such a risky space? Looking at NTLA, I believe it 
                              has been largely de-risked at this point. Some patients in the 2001-PN trial were dosed over 2 years 
                              ago. They've dosed over 50 with their 2 lead in-vivo medicines already.
                              Taking a look at the CRSP success also should help ease some concerns, however ex-vivo is largely less 
                              “dangerous.” CRSP has some patients who are still essentially cured after receiving their treatment 4 
                              years ago.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Also the nice thing about NTLA is the fact their 2 lead programs are nearly identical. The success and 
                              safety of 1 largely can be used to bolster the probability of success of the other.
                              I truly believe there are few stocks positioned as well for the next 4-5 years as they are. Add in the 
                              fact their CEO appears to be firing on all cylinders- everything they do is incredibly quick. 
                              So why BEAM? They appear the exact opposite so far- incredibly slow. Their tech is superior and they 
                              have the largest toolbox out of all the companies. They even have access to certain parts of prime 
                              editing. Base editing, when perfected, is better and safer than 1.0 CRISPR.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              BEAM can tackle many more diseases and I foresee bigger upside in the long run for this company. Their 
                              ESCAPE technology is exciting and puts them in the lead to cure sickle cell disease on a worldwide 
                              level.
                              I for one, do not expect the biggest bull-run for this exciting technology to have already happened. If 
                              you think it got out of hand before (which it totally did) just wait until we start parading cured 
                              patients out on CNBC to talk to Jim Cramer and the Fast Money crew!

                         <p>March 1, 2023 by <a href="https://twitter.com/Biotech2k1" target="_blank">@biotech2k1</a></p>
                         <p>
                              I have heard many people try to call this crash in biotech the end of the Biotechnology sector. 
                              A sector that has been around for decades. One of the most necessary sectors in the entire 
                              market. Here I am going to lay out for you the opposite case. I have been investing in tech and 
                              biotech for 27 years. I have seen so much technology that excites me about the future, and I see 
                              it today.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The biggest question I always get in biotech investing is when will we run out of things to 
                              discover or great new technologies to invent. My response is we will never run out until we cure 
                              every disease. We are entering a very exciting new era in biotechnology where we have new tools that 
                              could completely redefine the future. People who listen to those naysayers could be missing the best 
                              opportunity of their lifetimes. I actually have more excitement and investment ideas today than I ever 
                              had in my 27 years of investing. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              New technologies like using AI or Machine Learning to make new 
                              connections in biology or genetics could revolutionize how we approach drug discovery. Automation can 
                              reduce workloads and simplify redundant processes to bring down costs of drug discovery. We have come to 
                              call this space of biotech the TechBio space. This is just beginning to get started. Right now everyone 
                              is skeptical of this space. I think in 10 years, any company that did not embrace these technologies 
                              will fade away into the history books of time. There are going to be new leaders in this space that 
                              emerge to become tomorrow's Google or Amazon. We can find them today for a mere fraction of what they 
                              could be tomorrow. Most of these companies are selling near their levels of cash. The discovery of new 
                              technology will always get funding by the visionary few. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The next space of excitement is Gene Editing 
                              tools like CRISPR. These tools are in their infancy and will continue to evolve as bright minds continue 
                              to find new ways to use them to do editing safer and easier. Barriers like delivery will be broken 
                              and there will be a revolution in fixing and removing Genetic Diseases from the human race. The 
                              companies that succeed here will be worth fortunes. The power of gene editing has given birth to Synthetic
                              Biology. This is the ability to take gene editing tools and use it to reprogram microbes to make them 
                              beneficial. We can reprogram pathogens to produce fertilizer or scrub carbon from the environment. The 
                              future ability of scientist to rewrite life on earth using gene editing can be exciting and terribly 
                              frighting. It is an awesome power and responsibility. There is going to be a need for Biosecurity to 
                              protect us from the ability of bad actors to misuse this technology.  Rewriting life won't just stop 
                              with microbes. We can use it to create human cells from stem cells. We have technologies like Induced 
                              Pluripotent Stem cells called iPSC that can allow us to reprogram human cells. We can create cell therapies 
                              to fight cancer. This is just getting started as we learn more about cell biology and 
                              human biology. I believe someday we will be able to grow entire organs from a single cell donation. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The 
                              last area will be the revolution of Sequencing. This has been a space of rapid evolution. We are still 
                              far from the ability to do end to end sequencing on every genome on earth for a very low cost. Someday, we 
                              will get our genome sequenced and we will know everything about ourselves. The risk and the benefits. We 
                              will be able to tailor medicine to the individual. Personalized medicine is only just beginning with 
                              cancer therapies. Someday we will know our risk long before it even becomes a disease. We will be focused 
                              more on prevention and correction before the disease occurs. Combining sequencing with other therapies 
                              like gene editing could allow sickness to be corrected before it happens. While many have taken to writing 
                              articles predicting the end of biotechnology, I have taken to the spreading of the Science Of The Future. 
                              I think scary sells a lot of articles, but vision will favor the patient investor.
