                         <p> 
                              Investing is the best way a person has to build their money over the long term. When you look at cash 
                              accounts like Savings, Money Markets and Certificates of Deposit, they pay less than 1% interest on 
                              average. You might get a few percent out of a CD. If you want to reach your long term financial goals, 
                              you will have to use investing where average returns can be between 6% and 10%. You can get more than 
                              that, but then you have to take on more risk. Investing requires risk, but without investing, you will 
                              never achieve those goals you want for the long term. If you put aside $500 per month for 40 years into 
                              a savings account, you might have about $295,000 in cash at 1% interest rates. That is never going to get you to your goals 
                              of retirement. If you put that same $500 into a tax free account like an IRA for 40 years at a 6% rate 
                              of return from stocks and bonds, you would have over $950,000. That is a massive difference of $650,000 
                              by taking on a bit more risk of investing. The amount of risk you are willing to take will vary from 
                              investor to investor.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="allocation">Asset Allocation</h2>
                         <p> 

                              Asset allocation is about picking the right types of investment to achieve your investment goals. 
                              There are a lot of different assets from Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities,  and Currencies. 
                              Each of these assets has a different risk and reward profile. Stocks tend to average about 10% 
                              annual over the long term. They can have big swings of upward of 20% in a single year, but the 
                              average is about 10% returns per year. The return is 10% and the risk is 20%. Bonds tend to return 
                              5% to 6% on average depending on the bonds. They tend to be less volatile with bonds moving about 
                              10% in the big swings. You have a lower return, but you also have lower risk. Other assets like 
                              Real Estate, Commodities and Currencies can be even more rewarding, but they bring with them more 
                              risk.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Know Your Goals</h3>
                         <p>
                              The most important thing to consider when you are starting to invest is what your goal is. I see a 
                              lot of investors who jump into investing with a get rich quick mentality. They have no plan and 
                              they tend to do poorly vs the average returns of the market. The first thing you need to know is 
                              what you want to achieve from investing. Most people will find they can reach all their goals with 
                              a simple diversified index fund. They don't need to beat the market. They just need to perform 
                              inline with the market. That makes long term investing a very simple task for them as they can 
                              automate contributions and just track how things are going from time to time. If you are getting 
                              started later than other investors, you might have to play catch up. This might be a situation 
                              where you might embrace a bit more risk and use less bonds and more risky investments like stocks, 
                              real estate and commodities. Your goals will dictate what level of risk you need to take as an 
                              investor. You should never take on any more risk than you absolutely have to.
                         </p>  
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Types of Assets</h3>
                         <p>
                              Bonds are owning debt. It can be debt of the Federal Government like Treasury Bonds, it can be debt of 
                              local and state authorities like Municipal Bonds, or it can be the debt of companies like Corporate 
                              Bonds. Each level of these bonds has different risks and rewards. The same theory applies. The more risk 
                              you assume the more reward you can get with bonds. Government Bonds are considered to be risk free as 
                              the government never fails to pay its bills. At least it hasn't for the last 200 years. The returns on 
                              the treasury bond are typically the lowest. We often measure this by the 10 year yield for bonds which 
                              sits at 3.82%. That means you can already double or triple your return by own Treasury Bonds over a 
                              savings account. Municipal Bonds are from local and state governments. They do have risk as there have 
                              been some high profile bankruptcies from states and cities. Each of these bonds gets a credit rating 
                              from a ratings agency like S&P. You can use those ratings like triple A to find the highest quality 
                              Municipal Bonds. Many states allow you to earn income on these bonds tax free if you own Municipal 
                              bonds from your home state. The final type of bonds is corporate bonds. They are considered the most 
                              risky class of bond. There is a vast difference between corporate bonds with high quality companies 
                              like Apple and Junk Bonds. Junk Bonds are what we call the bonds of the below investment grade ranked 
                              companies by the S&P ratings. Apple is rated at AA. Any bond over triple B is considered 
                              investment grade. Below triple B is considered Junk Bonds.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Stocks are equity ownership in a company. We call them publicly owned companies. These companies are 
                              owned by shareholders who own tiny fractions of the overall company. A single share of the company 
                              entitles you to a share of the profits or losses of that company. You might not be able to build your 
                              own business, but you can own a tiny part of great companies like Apple or Amazon. Stocks are 
                              considered a more risky investment than bonds. They tend to average returns of 10% a year, but 
                              individual stocks can be very volatile. Apple might move 10% to 20% a year in stock price, but a 
                              speculative biotechnology or technology stock might swing 70% in a single year. Stocks are ownership 
                              in a company. That means you have the risk of what might happen to that company. Some companies go 
                              bankrupt. The best way to own stocks is by owning a large index of stocks to capture the average returns 
                              of the market without the individual risk of any one company.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Real Estate is owning property. Many of us already own a home. That is real estate. When it comes to 
                              investing, you might go out and buy up property and become a landlord or real estate expert. For the 
                              average investor, real estate will come from owning Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). These are 
                              large investing groups that pool together investor money by selling shares like stocks. They take all 
                              that money and they invest it into properties where they hire managers. Real estate tends to do well in 
                              inflationary and low interest rate environments as they borrow a lot of money to buy these properties so 
                              they have to pay interest on all those mortgages. The returns on real estate can be upward of 12% to 
                              14%, but then they can have higher volatility as they do well in low rates and poorly in high rates 
                              environments. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              Commodities is another asset class many investors like to own. These tend to act like a hedge since 
                              they often do well when investors panic. They tend to protect against inflation and do well as a hedge 
                              against the dollar. Many investors will insist on keeping at least 5% to 10% of their investments in 
                              commodities like Gold or Silver. You can do this by owning the physical asset like buying gold from a 
                              broker and keeping it in a safe at home. Many investors will own commodities like Oil, Gold and Silver 
                              through index funds. These are funds that pool together investor money and buy the physical assets and 
                              store them somewhere safe. They sell shares in that store of assets like they would a stock. The stock 
                              of those assets will fluctuate with the value of the underlying assets. They will buy or sell the 
                              assets in the warehouse based on investors buying or selling their stock.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Portfolio Theory and The Efficient Market Theory</h3>
                         <p>
                              Portfolio Theory is a fancy concept by which financial experts will design a portfolio of assets 
                              using mathematical formulas to achieve the perfect level of return for the level of risk each 
                              investor is comfortable with. Today, this can easily be done by AI and robo advisors. You can punch 
                              in your information to a robo advisor so it can determine what your financial goals are and what 
                              level of risk you are comfortable with. Then it actually picks a portfolio of assets for you to 
                              reach that perfect level of risk and reward. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The other concept is The Efficient Market theory which I subscribe to for the most part. This says 
                              that the millions of participants of the market are listening to all the news and taking into 
                              account all the facts. The market prices itself efficiently because the millions of participants 
                              are taking into account all the foreseen data around the economy and the market. I find this tends 
                              to be true for the overall market and it prices in all the news and events. I always say if you 
                              think you see something coming for the market, the market has already seen it and priced it into 
                              the price of the market. Where I find the market tends to fail to be efficient is in pricing 
                              individual companies. The market paints with a broad brush. If it likes oil and hates 
                              biotechnology, it will own all oil even the worst companies. It will in the same way dump all 
                              biotechnology companies including the best companies. This is where I have spent my 27 years of 
                              investing. I look for companies that are mispriced because their sector is currently hated by the 
                              market. Then I try to find and own the best companies in that sector as they will be cheap.

                              If you believe in efficient market theory, then you believe the average investor will never beat 
                              the market. The data supports this theory as less than 10% of active investors can actually 
                              outperform the market over a 5 year period. It shows about 20% can do it for a single year, but 
                              less than 10% can do it consistently. Those statistics are good enough for me. This means all you 
                              need to do is weight the market. What does that mean? If you are designing a portfolio which has 
                              an asset allocation of 60% stocks, then you just allocate that 60% to a low cost market index fund. 
                              This fund will give you the average performance of the market over time. An investor who believes 
                              in efficient market theory would just use a low cost index for bonds, stocks and commodities to 
                              reach their weighting for each asset. The term weight just means how much of an asset you own. If 
                              I own more Apple than I do Ford, then I am weighting Apple more than Ford.

                         <p>
                              So what is asset allocation? This is determining how much of each asset you are going to own in your 
                              portfolio. The classic portfolio of my childhood was you weighted bonds to the same as your age then 
                              you filled the rest of your portfolio with stocks. If you are 25 and just getting started, you would 
                              own 25% bonds and 75% stocks. As you get older, you slowly shift the balance from the more risky, 
                              higher return stocks and toward the lower risk, lower return bonds. This ensures capital 
                              preservation as you approach retirement. This is an important term to understand in investing. When 
                              we invest money, there is a risk we can lose some or all of that initial investment. Companies 
                              default on bonds and go bankrupt. There is no risk free investment. Capital preservation is about 
                              reducing risk so you don't lose your input invested cash. As you get closer and closer to retirement, 
                              the desire to protect your money increases. The last thing you want is to reach a year from 
                              retirement and see all your stocks collapse 30% right before you plan to retire. You might be forced 
                              to delay retirement.

                              Portfolio Theory now embraces all asset classes. There is a point where taking on some additional 
                              risk can help returns with very minimal impact to the risk profile while helping improve returns. 
                              Even adding a little bit of some super risky assets can add a bit of performance to a well allocated 
                              portfolio without ratcheting up the risk a whole lot. I have seen portfolio designs which showed 
                              adding a super speculative asset like crypto made for an efficient portfolio. When it comes to 
                              portfolio theory, you will see the term efficiency frontier. This is a curve that shows various 
                              combinations of assets in various amounts and how they affect the risk and return of that portfolio.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Risk vs Reward</h3>
                         <p>
                              When it comes to investing, I find too many investors only focus on the rewards and dismiss the 
                              risk. They take way too much risk and end up underperforming the market. They would actually do 
                              better just owning the market using a low cost index fund. So what is this index fund I keep talking 
                              about? Index funds take money and they use it to buy stock, bonds, real estate or commodities using 
                              the same weightings as their respective market. A stock index would own all stocks and weigh them in 
                              that index based on the market size of each company. A mega company like Apple would be a large part 
                              of every index fund while a tiny company would have very little weight in that index. There are two 
                              types of index funds with mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF). The mutual fund will buy 
                              assets in weights equal to the market then they will sell shares in their fund to investors. These 
                              are called mutual funds. Some of them have high fees and many have time requirements for ownership. The 
                              ETF takes the same approach where they sell shares in their fund and use that money to buy assets in 
                              equal weights to all the stocks in the market. They act very much like a stock of a company except 
                              you own all the companies in the market and not just one company. ETFs are an excellent way to own an 
                              asset like stocks, bonds, real estate or commodities. Some of them are managed and they require more 
                              expenses which come out of the fund itself and lower returns. Others are designed to be low cost 
                              with minimal management as they just weigh an asset equal to the overall market. Some examples of 
                              good ETFs are like the SPY for the S&P 500. There is the VTI which mimics the overall market. There 
                              are bond ETFs like BND or HYG that own bonds. You can even own an EFT for Oil, Gold and Silver with 
                              USO, GLD or SLV. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              If you come up with an asset allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, you can do this by picking a low 
                              cost index fund or ETF that is offered in your 401k, IRA or self directed investment account. You can 
                              have an IRA with your broker and do asset allocation of 60% VIT  for stocks and 40% TLT for bonds. I 
                              have gone over 401k and IRA investments with many people. Every one of these company plans will have 
                              at least one low cost fund that will give you the exposure to the asset you want to meet your 
                              allocation to that asset. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When in doubt, you should seek the advice of a professional. They go to school to learn how to 
                              efficiently build portfolios for each client based on their goals and risk appetite. You can do it 
                              yourself, but you might not have the most efficient portfolio you can have. Picking individual stocks 
                              I do not believe should be for most investors. I believe 90% of investors would do best to contribute 
                              every payday to your employer's tax free investment account they offer you. You should allocate that 
                              money to funds that are low cost for the assets you chose to own. Stock picking is fun and it can be 
                              very enjoyable for many investors. I think it should be done in moderation especially for new 
                              investors.

                              Now we are going to start to look at strategies to build a portfolio of investments. This will be 
                              about picking individual stocks, bonds, REITs or commodity indexes to reach our investment goals. 
                              If you have 60% of your assets in stocks, you may choose to pick individual companies. In that 
                              case, you will need additional strategies to help protect you from the risks and maximize the 
                              return. This can be things like using diversification to spread out risk over many companies. It 
                              can be using sector allocations to take advantage of some sectors doing well during good periods of 
                              the economy and other sectors doing well in weaker periods of the economy. It can use strategies like 
                              weighting some companies more than others as they are safer or provide a desired return. There is 
                              a lot of planning that can go into building a portfolio that performs to the return you like for a 
                              level of risk you are comfortable with.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Active vs Passive Investing</h3>
                         <p>
                              Up till now we talked about passive investing and how to allocate capital using investments that 
                              mimic the overall market or the asset class they are designed to track. Passive investing works for 
                              millions of investors who want to invest to meet their long term goals. Active investing appeals 
                              to a lot of investors who want to pick stocks. There is something fun and exciting about picking 
                              stocks for yourself. The truth is most active investors never beat the market. If you are going to 
                              pick stocks yourself, you should accept the fact you might underperform the overall market. I think 
                              active investing for a small part of a bigger asset allocation might be best for many investors. 
                              This gives you a small portfolio to dabble while keeping the vast majority of your investment in 
                              assets that will perform as expected. I have a few portfolios that I have developed for active 
                              investing that I call discretionary portfolios. They are built from funds I do not need or would 
                              not matter if they are lost. They don't count for my retirement. That is often the best way to 
                              start with active investing. 
                         </p>
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Trading vs Investing</h3>
                         <p>
                              I would bet that the vast majority of the market today is short term trading. Most investing funds 
                              and active investors today do trading based on technical indicators of some kind. This involves 
                              charts and other indicators such as trend or volume. I have never gotten into trading, but the 
                              statistics suggest the vast majority of traders do not outperform the market. When everyone is 
                              looking at the same charts and the same patterns, trading often becomes a game of the herd chasing the 
                              same trade. I call it the momentum trade. Everyone buys as long as the chart is strong and everyone
                              sells as long as the chart is weak. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Investing is about finding great companies with strong fundamentals and buying their stock for the 
                              long term. It is about ownership in a company and its products or services. Investing doesn't have 
                              much concern with the short term moves of the market or the economy. For an investor, weakness in 
                              the economy or the market overall is an opportunity to buy more stock at a cheaper price. From here 
                              on out, we will solely focus on strategies for investors with few exceptions. I tend to be a long 
                              term investor, but I like to trade around my positions from time to time to take profits and buy 
                              back cheaper.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Diversification</h3>
                         <p>
                              Diversification is the first tool and most powerful tool of the investor. It is about spreading 
                              around your money so that any one company does not make up too much of your portfolio. I have seen 
                              a lot of investors go all in on one company. Sometimes it is a successful company and they do very 
                              well. This is an extremely dangerous way to invest. All you have to do is ask the investors who bet 
                              everything on companies like Enron or Theranos. Diversification is the most powerful tool an 
                              investor has against risk of single company ownership. In the same way we would own different assets 
                              to help protect against market risk, diversification helps protect against single company risk.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are different levels of diversification. Some people will tell you it is fine to own just a 
                              handful of stocks with a larger percentage of your money in each stock. Others will say you should 
                              own a bunch of companies to spread out the risk. I think that depends on each person. The more 
                              companies you own, the more work you will have to do to keep up with them all. The more companies 
                              you own the more work you have to put into investing. Time is a resource that will be important in 
                              determining how diversified you can be. The type of companies you own will matter. If you are 
                              picking large companies that are stable like Apple or Amazon, you could  have few companies with 
                              bigger positions. If you are picking a lot of small companies with a high level of risk, then maybe 
                              you want to spread out your investments across many more companies.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I tend to dabble in the most risky parts of the market like small cap technology, small cap 
                              biotechnology and crypto. This means I like to really spread things out as the risk of failure is 
                              also high. I used to do at least 10 companies and around 10% in each company. That worked fine, but 
                              losing 10% when a company goes bad was more than I was happy with losing. Over time I added more 
                              companies until I reached around 20. That gives me 5% or less in each company. That is a very 
                              acceptable level of loss should something go wrong. That is what I am comfortable with. You will 
                              have to decide for yourself based on what kind of companies you own, how much time you have and what 
                              level of risk you are comfortable with.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Sector Allocation</h3>
                         <p>
                              Sector allocation is another important part of diversification. Not every sector does well at the 
                              same time during any economy. Some sectors hold up well during bad times and might even do better in 
                              a weak economy. We call them the consumer staples. They are the things people can not live without regardless 
                              of how the economy is doing. They are things like food and drug stocks along with utilities. They 
                              have stable earnings no matter what economy we are in. They tend to do well in a weak economy and 
                              poorly when the economy is strong.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Other sectors tend to be very strong when the economy is roaring. They tend to be the companies that 
                              make more money when people have more money to spend like retail, industrials and consumer 
                              discretionary sectors. We call these sectors of the economy the cyclical sectors as they will do well 
                              at one part of the economic cycle and poorly at another part of the economic cycle. There are some 
                              sectors we call secular sectors. They don't move with the economy, but tend to have their own cycles 
                              where there is a boom and bust. Things like telecom and technology tend to have their own cycles 
                              depending on rollouts of new technology in development. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Spreading your money across multiple sectors allows you to ensure you have at least something that is 
                              doing well no matter what part of the economic cycle we are in. When I was a young investor, I had a 
                              set of sectors that I would always own because they gave me broad coverage of the economic cycle. I 
                              always had an Oil company, Bank, Industrial, Telecom and a Utility at the least. If we were in the 
                              upcycle, I would add more of the sectors like retail and consumer discretionary. In the down part of 
                              the cycle, I would add more of the steady dividend stocks like food and drug stocks.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Weighting</h3>
                         <p>
                              This is about how much of a stock you own. We call it the weighting of the stock in the portfolio. 
                              Some investors will weigh every company equally. This is how I do it on my cost basis. I will buy up 
                              to an equal weight of a stock based on what I pay for it. I own about the same amount for each 
                              company. Some I will own more as I like them more while others I will own less as I don't have as 
                              much conviction in them. My max weight for a company is around 5% of my portfolio. Some of them are 
                              a bit more and several of them have less than that amount. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some investors will weigh their companies by the level of conviction they have in them. They will have 
                              larger amounts of the companies they love and less of the companies they don't have as much conviction 
                              in. They might own 10% or 20% in one company they believe in the most and a few others they only own a 
                              few percent in like 5% in a few other companies they think might be great in that space. I think 
                              this is a good strategy when the big weighted companies are big cap safer companies. Sometimes 
                              investors will have a large weighting in a company that is very speculative which then makes this 
                              strategy more risky. Regardless of which strategy you use, you will have to consider how much weight 
                              you will give each company in your portfolio.

                         <p>
                              Value investing is about finding companies that look cheap based on their assets or cash flows. It has 
                              metrics like a price to earning ratio, margins, cash flows and assets. I spent many years as a value 
                              investor looking for companies that were beaten down and trading at a discount to their intrinsic 
                              value. The value investor is looking for companies that are trading at a discount to their intrinsic 
                              value based on some macroeconomic forces or because the company might be facing some challenges. Many 
                              large companies in the market will fall into the value category. Most of them have low growth rates 
                              and are fully mature companies. The key to the value investor is about finding the companies which are 
                              trading as a discount and holding them until the market values them correctly. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Growth investing is all about the future. Many growth companies are in their early years of startup 
                              and many are not even profitable yet. They receive revenues, but they don't have any profits as they 
                              spend more than they make to drive growth. For the growth investor, it is all about what the company 
                              will become in the future. This makes growth investing very risky as some of these companies will not 
                              be successful. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I find that investors will typically be drawn to one type of these investments or the other. I rarely 
                              find an investor which will do both value and growth investing. Most investors will end up falling in 
                              love with one type or other. Some will love the treasure hunt of investing in growth companies while 
                              others will find value metrics to be more their thing. It is my belief that owning value is the same 
                              as owning the market and I would just use an index. I am a growth investor. I only like to pick 
                              individual companies that I think will become a huge success someday. That means I take on a lot of 
                              risk, but I only do so in my discretionary portfolios where I can afford the losses. I use a ton of 
                              risk mitigation strategies to ensure I don't lose a lot of money. That probably costs me something on 
                              the big winners when I hit on them, but it is worth the trade off as the failure rate in early stage 
                              companies is very high.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">My Portfolio Building Strategy</h3>
                         <p> 
                              I started in 1996 and have been actively investing for 27 years. I have been retired since 2000 and 
                              doing investing as a hobby. I have a small biotech portfolio I started back in 2011 that I use for playing 
                              biotech stocks. I typically have between 10 and 20 companies in my portfolio. Right now, I think it 
                              is well over 30. That is because the market has been in such a huge bear market for biotech
                              that I have been buying everything I can. I don't like to put too much stock in any one company as biotech is
                              very speculative, and the statistics show that 90% of these early stage companies fail. I usually don't 
                              put more than 3% to 5% in any single company. At least not early on. 
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              I like to play baskets of companies based on key science concepts. I start with concepts like 
                              Techbio, CRISPR, Synthetic Biology and iPSC. Then I assess every company in that space until I find 
                              all the top companies I like. I will build a basket of those companies. I typically have 3 to 5 
                              science themes and each theme has a max cap of 20% of my portfolio. I will usually have 3 to 5 companies 
                              in each theme. Less than 2 companies and it is not a theme. More than 5 has to be narrowed down to the 
                              best of the best. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I never risk more than 3% to 5% of my money in any single company. That means I will only exceed that limit
                              if I have enough capital gains to reduce my cost basis. For example, if I had gains that equal 2% of total 
                              portfolio in a company, I would be willing to own up to 7% of my total in that company because only 5% of 
                              that would be my money. The rest is already paid for. Most of the time, I am cutting companies out that did 
                              not live up to expectations while building positions into new companies into market corrections.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I never buy all my stock in a company at one time. I tend to like to nibble away at it as it comes down in 
                              price. With today's free trading at most brokers, there is no reason to buy a ton of stock at one time unless 
                              you think you can predict the market. Once I have built my position in a company, I tend to trade around that 
                              position taking profits when the markets are up and buying some back when the markets are down. I tend to use 
                              20% as a rule for buying or selling on stock moves, but not always. I like to watch the market sentiment to see 
                              when things are over loved or over hated. I never sell my core shares in a company unless I think it has become 
                              fundamentally broken. I try to keep half of my position as my core position and use half for trading around 
                              my position into the market swings. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I find this strategy works best for me as it gives me the best of long term investing and the best of short 
                              term trading. It keeps me active enough that I don't get bored and quit, but also focused on the long term so 
                              I don't miss the bigger picture. This is just my strategy.

                         <p> 
                              Now I am going to share with you how I do my due diligence for companies. This is just my method. I 
                              am sure everyone else has their own. I tend to spend a lot of time getting to know a company very 
                              well. I like to follow them and get a good feel for the company and the management team. I am never 
                              in a hurry when shopping for a new company. I make sure I take my time and do all the work before I 
                              start to buy. Then I start by buying a tiny position to get started. I will nibble away at the 
                              position over time as I get more and more familiar with the company and confident in my investment. 
                              If at any time I start to doubt, I stop buying so that my position doesn't get bigger. This often 
                              stops me from taking a full position in a company that I will end up selling later once my concern 
                              comes about. 
                         </p>
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Macro is a Backdrop</h3>
                         <p> 
                              When it comes to picking a good long term investment, I find too many investors get distracted by 
                              the macroeconomic backdrop. They let a down market dissuade them from buying a great long term 
                              investment. The negative sentiment causes them to not buy when the price is actually at its 
                              cheapest. The economy has its boom and its bust periods. The good news is the bust periods typically last one to 
                              two years. The booms can last for many years or even a decade. Taking advantage of a weak market or 
                              economic backdrop is actually the best asset of a long term investor. There should be no reason 
                              a recession today or next year would stop you from owning a company you think could be worth 10 
                              times this value in another 10 or 20 years. Yet, no matter how many times I try to teach investors 
                              this concept, they still get hung up in the panic and fear of a down market.

                              If you really love investing and picking companies, then you should desire to know everything you 
                              can about them. No one should know more about your companies than you. Obviously, the management 
                              and insiders will always be privy to information no one else has. No other investor should know 
                              something that is publicly available information and you do not know it. This means you have to 
                              spend a lot of time digging through financial reports, presentations, publications and listening 
                              to webcasts. The only competitive advantage vs other investors you have is knowledge. You should 
                              know every partnership, every lawsuit, every data read out and the amount of sales each company 
                              has. Here I am going to share with you my system for doing research on companies before I ever make 
                              a purchase.

                              The first thing I will do for a company that is new to me is look over their science. I know the 
                              science and I know what looks like it could work and what looks like it could have problems. I 
                              really need to see how the science works and what the data looks like before I decide if it can be a 
                              huge winner or a struggling science concept. If the company has recently gone public, they will 
                              have a recently published S-1 which is put out ahead of the IPO. These usually go very in depth 
                              into the science of the company. If the company is within a few years of the IPO, I will go back 
                              and find the S-1 and go through the science to see if it has any issues or problems. Any company 
                              that is at least a year old will have published an annual report 10K. This is a very in depth 
                              document like the S-1 and gets published each year. I am going to read that and make sure I am 
                              up to date on any data that might have come out since the S-1. Then I check the quarterly report 
                              10Q to ensure  I have the latest data possible.

                              The next thing I really want to look at for a company is the Indications and how big they are. 
                              Small indications make small profits while big indications make big profits. This is important to 
                              the long term success of the company. I want to know if there are any partners and how they take 
                              off the sales of any product. I want to really know the financial terms. There is no point to 
                              owning a company if you don't know what it could be worth in 10 years. The only way to do that is 
                              to look at its pipeline and figure out what it can earn in revenues and then figure out what those 
                              revenues can be worth.

                              You might say, what about management? What about them? The only way to really know a management 
                              team is to follow them over time and see how well they do. This is the hardest part of any 
                              investment as management can make or break the best companies. It is never something you are going 
                              to read in a 500 page document. It can only be determined by watching how a management team handles 
                              its affairs for presentations, financial management, navigating the regulatory process and building 
                              the company.

                              I like to go through the press releases of the company. If it is a younger company, I tend to start 
                              at the very first press release and go through them in chronological order. This gives me a very 
                              good feel of the news and events in actual time. I can see what decisions the company has made for 
                              its programs and finances and build a picture of how well they are developing the company over time. 
                              I tend to go through at least 3 years of press releases, but I will often start at the beginning 
                              and skim through them all for a company that is new to me.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Webcast Conferences</h3>
                         <p>
                              When it comes to getting to know management, nothing helps better than listening to them present 
                              and speak. You can get a good feel for how they handle themselves. You can tell if they make hyped 
                              up claims to pump the company. This is distasteful as many of the management teams that resort to 
                              hype do so as they lack real sustenance. I can tell if a CEO delegates by allowing his other team 
                              members to take charge of their respective fields like finance or science. A CEO that dominates 
                              and doesn't delegate worries me. I can tell if the CEO knows science or is a finance professional. 
                              Both can do well, but they need to know both skills or be willing to delegate those areas to 
                              someone who does. A business person CEO teamed with a great science CSO often does really well. 
                              You can get to know a management team and how proficient at their job they are by just listening 
                              to how they present over time. I will often go through at least a year's worth of webcasts if they 
                              are available. That gets me a few earnings calls and several science conferences if I am lucky. If 
                              a company doesn't have those webcasts then I will follow them in real time until I hear enough to 
                              feel comfortable with the management team. It just takes longer.

                         <p> 
                              I like to go through the posters, publications and presentations. Not every company will have a 
                              page of their website where they put publications, but I find I am more confident in the companies 
                              that share this data. The publications are data that is published in various journals or at science 
                              meetings. I will also go through the slide decks from the company. Some companies will put out a 
                              slide deck every month. These can often give very useful data about the indications, their size, 
                              the competition and potential. 
                         </p>  
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Staying up to Date</h3>
                         <p>
                              Once I have done all my initial due diligence, I don't just stop there. I keep up with all these 
                              events. I usually pick one weekend a month where I will go through all the press releases, events, 
                              slide decks and SEC filings for each company I own. It has been so important to me, that I put all 
                              these links on every company's profile on this website. This saves me a huge amount of time trying 
                              to go to the website of each company one at a time and find the information. You should get to know 
                              the company's website. It will be your top source of information for each company you own. I even 
                              have a bookmark folder for each company I own.

                         <p> 
                              Here I am going to share with you the top things I look for in any company I invest in. There are a 
                              lot of things that go into building a great company, but I tend to focus on fundamentals and 
                              valuation. They seem to influence the company's chance of success with the greatest impact. 
                              Fundamentals are about the quality of the company. Fundamentals tell me which companies I should buy. 
                              I also focus on the value of the company. Value tells me when I should buy a company.  When it comes 
                              to fundamentals, I tend to focus on two key aspects of companies that I feel are the magic formula to 
                              success. They are Management and Science. Then I look at the financial potential of the company and 
                              its current valuation. Lastly, I look at the risks of the company.
                         </p>
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Management</h3>
                         <p>
                              Great management can turn even average science into a successful company. Bad management can wreck 
                              even the best science. I would never own a company with what I perceive to be weak management. When 
                              I look at a company's management, I really look at the CEO. They are the captain of the ship and 
                              ultimately all decisions go through them. I like to evaluate a company's management over time. It 
                              really takes time to figure out if management knows what they are talking about, and if they are 
                              living up to their promises.
                         </p>
                         <p>   
                              I like to go over at least a year's worth of conferences, webcasts and earnings calls. I take notes on 
                              what was promised, like drug development timelines, and then I check off the promises delivered and 
                              circle those that are not. If they miss a deadline, and they provide a good reason for it, I will let 
                              it go. I know Covid has delayed many company's deadlines. I don't expect perfection. I expect 
                              consistency. As long as there is not a habit of dropping the ball. I like to follow a company for a 
                              few months and listen to conferences in real time before I make any commitment to buy. Then I start 
                              slowly with a small position and only add when I think the company is impressing me with the results 
                              like data or events. It is like any other relationship. I have to take the time to get to know the 
                              company and trust the management before I commit my hard earned money to them.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              A great CEO will be honest and have integrity. They are straight shooters. They are going to tell you 
                              what they expect and admit when the results don't match up to it. A weak CEO will try to explain away 
                              bad data or try to spin bad data as if it were good data. Those are the ones you have to be aware of. 
                              A great CEO just lets the data speak for itself, and tells the truth. A great CEO is also a great 
                              communicator. They go to various conferences and love to talk about their company. They also have to 
                              be able to communicate well. You want to see the CEO be able to handle the tough questions with grace 
                              and ease. What I don't want to see is a CEO who is hyping or pumping up the science or company. They 
                              tend to be the worst with throwing around flashy buzz words just to crush investors when it all 
                              fails.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              A great CEO must be a good financial manager. Managing cash balance is key in the biotech market 
                              where a stock can go through long periods of "out of favor". I like to see at least 2 years of cash 
                              on the balance sheet to get through the lean times. It is also important for a CEO to time the 
                              secondaries when they will be best received. I like to see them take advantage of investor optimism 
                              and sell into the big rallies based on good data or just market excitement. Another major aspect of 
                              good financial management is not recklessly spending money. I see some companies that have just so 
                              much going on that they burn huge amounts of cash. They become giant money pits.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A great CEO needs to navigate the regulatory process very well. I see it too often where an 
                              inexperienced CEO makes tons of blunders with trial design, regulatory submission, manufacturing 
                              inspections and communicating with the FDA. This leads to delays in timing of trials, clinical holds, 
                              Complete Response Letters (CRL's) or even bad trial outcomes. It can be hard to know if a CEO is one 
                              of these rookies, but it usually shows up quickly in the data.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              The last and most important attribute of a CEO for me is visionary. A great CEO has to make great 
                              decisions around company development. They have a vision about their company and where they want it 
                              to go. They make great decisions to develop the long term story. They make good partnerships where 
                              needed. They make good decisions about which indications to pursue first. Some CEO's lack decision 
                              making and spend a huge amount of money trying to chase everything at once. A good leader will pick 
                              a few key programs and pursue them to commercial before spending more money. A good leader won't 
                              always be perfect so I don't sell on just one bad event like a trial failure or a delay with a trial. 
                              If it becomes a habit by happening more than once, then that is an alarm the CEO might not be up to 
                              the task. I personally think that management makes up about 70% of the value of a company.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Science</h3>
                         <p>
                              The quality of the science is the other part of the magic formula for a winning company. I look for a 
                              technology platform that can yield many new drugs. I also like companies focused on mastering one 
                              science. Some companies look like a swap meet of different technologies. They tend to be a Jack of 
                              all Trades, but a master of none. Here are some attributes that I look for in a company's science 
                              and pipeline.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              When it comes to science, there is never a lack of great companies out there who are innovating. That 
                              means great companies have more than one drug in the pipeline. I don't want any one-hit wonders. They 
                              tend to be too volatile and way too binary. They are either huge wins or massive losses. They can be 
                              gut wrenching. I want a technology platform that can yield many successful drugs. Those are the big 
                              winners when their technology works out. They can keep following up one success after another.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I like to look for companies that have science that separates them from the rest of the pack. You 
                              want a competitive advantage in any business and game changing science is one such method. I want 
                              superior science compared to peers, or I want a company with no competition in a new area of science. 
                              I tend to focus on picking areas of science that are leading the technology in the industry. This 
                              means I am betting on my ability to pick out innovative new science. I have to assume I will be wrong 
                              on a lot of these companies as they are so speculative and early stage. I manage this using strategy. 
                              I pick a basket of companies in a new innovative space and place small bets on each. Then I monitor 
                              them as they advance the science. I use the data to weed out the weak companies and buy more of the 
                              winners. I reward success and don't reward failure.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              When evaluating companies as the data comes in, I don't dump a company if they have a failure early 
                              on. Too many times, I have seen a company fail once just to make a massive comeback. Failure is part 
                              of the game for early stage biotech. What I don't want to see is a pattern of failure. If I have a 
                              company that has a big clinical setback, I put them on probation until they get another data readout. 
                              Good data forgives the older failure, but another failure confirms it.
                         </p>
                         <p>  
                              The final aspect is I focus on key areas of science. Biotech is a big space. There is a lot of 
                              science across so many areas of disease. I find I do better when I pick a few key areas to focus on. 
                              Sure, I might miss a great company that develops a good new Alzheimer's drug. That is fine because my 
                              focus allows me to be an expert in the areas I focus on. I have more success when I focus. I used to 
                              cover anything in biotech, but I found that I was hindered by areas of science where I did not have 
                              the expertise to keep up. That is when I switched to focus on key science themes for me. I focus on 
                              Genetics, Immunology, Hematology and Oncology. They are all extremely complementary to each other. 
                              Oncology actually requires a mastery of Genetics and Immunology.

                         <p>
                              When we are investing, we only have a limited amount of capital. That means you want to get the best 
                              possible return for the amount of money you invest. I have a saying that goes, “I love big indications 
                              and I can not lie”. If I am looking at two companies that have great science, which one has the biggest 
                              potential? One might have an innovative drug, but it only applies to a few hundred patients. The other 
                              might be just as innovative but help millions of patients. When investing in companies, I want to pick 
                              those who have innovation, but also the largest potential. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When it comes to returns in an investment, sales drive profits which drive returns. That means I want to 
                              pick companies that have the biggest potential market size. I can see a company with 18 indications, but 
                              they are all very small indications. Another company might have a handful of indications, but one or two 
                              of them could be multi billion dollar opportunities. I see too many investors get hung up on the science 
                              and forget all about what it might actually mean in sales. After all, we are investors and we are here 
                              to make money in our investments. I love to see good science helping sick people, but I always want to 
                              see how much money it will make me.

                         <p>
                              Understanding partnerships for companies is important to understanding the potential of the company. 
                              If they only get 20% of the revenues on a product, it offers less potential than another product that 
                              might get 50%. The use of partnerships is a double edge sword for young companies. Having a partner 
                              can help spread out the risk for an early stage biotech. It can help provide cash in the form of 
                              upfront payments and milestones. It can even bring in important expertise to a young company to help 
                              them grow, learn and develop. A partnership sells out a chunk of the future potential for something 
                              right now like desperately needed cash. It is important to understand the financial term of 
                              partnerships and how they impact the long term potential of the company.

                         <p>
                              Investors see partnerships as a stamp of validation for the company's science. I agree that it can be 
                              nice to have a bigger company partner with one of my companies as it does say they see something in 
                              the science. The issue with that belief is many big cap companies will make many partnerships with 
                              smaller companies, and they don't expect them to always work out. They often abandon partnerships 
                              with smaller companies when they change their plans. I like it when a company uses partnerships 
                              wisely and sparingly, but doesn't over use them. I am not a fan of companies that excessively use 
                              partners as it gives away too much potential.

                         <p>
                              Valuation is what the company is currently worth. The market itself works like a popularity contest 
                              as investors go from euphoria to panic and back to euphoria again. That means companies will be 
                              very expensive at times and very cheap at other times. The real value lies somewhere in between. As 
                              companies progress and develop, their value will grow. We can calculate the value of a company at 
                              any point in its development. Then we can wait for the stock valuation to get below the intrinsic 
                              value we calculate. That makes value a measure of when we can buy a company.  I will spend an 
                              entire section on valuation.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Risk Factors</h3>
                         <p>
                              The last part of evaluating the fundamentals of any company is to look at the risks. All biotech 
                              has many of the same risks. Early stage companies are more risky than later stage or commercial 
                              companies. When I look at a company, I am looking for risks that go beyond the normal biotech 
                              risks. This can be a part of the science that seems like it hasn't been figured out yet. It might 
                              be a weakness in management. When it comes to investing, we want to make the best investments that 
                              require the lowest risk for the returns we seek. If I am looking at two companies with both being 
                              phase 1 with similar science and similar potential, I want the company that has the lowest risk.

                         <p> 
                              I have been valuing companies for about 27 years now. I was fascinated as a new investor on what 
                              made companies worth what they were worth. My first exploration into valuation was the classic 
                              Benjamin Graham with his book the Intelligent Investor. The is the man whom Warren Buffet studied 
                              under. It was all about paying for earnings. Most investors today would tell you that the valuation 
                              of the company is linked to the cash flows it produces. Many analysts now use a complex and very 
                              biased Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. But what about companies that are not profitable yet? 
                              After all, many of the best investments are early stage companies that are spending more than they 
                              make to drive growth. What are they really worth? Are they only worth the physical assets? Is 
                              there no value for technology and intellectual property? Here is a look at my evolution of looking 
                              at valuation over my 27 years as I went from a value investor to a growth investor with an eye for 
                              value.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Price to Earnings Ratio</h3>
                         <p>
                              When I first got started into the valuation game, I read the book "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin 
                              Graham. This book is the Bible of valuation. It was written in a time before the internet and the 
                              hyper growth companies. When doing valuation, it all comes down to what we will pay for earnings of a company. In a bull market, 
                              investors will often over pay for earnings. In a bear market, investors won't pay as much for those same 
                              earnings. We call the amount we pay for earnings the multiple. The multiple is based on earnings and it 
                              expands and compresses with the economy. Everyone has heard of the Price to Earnings multiple (P/E). 
                              That is the multiple we are talking about here. To give an example, I am going to use Apple.
                              We have the Price of the stock at around $153. It has earned $5.89 in trailing 12 months earnings. Once 
                              we have the Price and the Earnings, the P/E is simple math. 
                              It is the Price divided by the Earnings. In this case it's $153/$5.89. That comes out to 25.97. That is 
                              how they calculate Price to Earnings multiple.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The average P/E is considered 15 from the classical Ben Graham valuation days, but they never had hyper 
                              growth companies back then. Some of these companies can have 50% to 150% growth when they go public. 
                              In that case, how do we know if we are expensive on this P/E? When it comes to Apple, some people might 
                              think a 26 P/E isn't all that bad for such a great company. Others might find it extremely expensive 
                              when it's historically traded at 15 P/E. The rule is, The higher the level of growth, the more 
                              investors will pay for those earnings. Often, I will do a P/E for the current year and then for next 
                              year. That will give you an idea of how expensive the company is on forward earnings. This helps 
                              compensate for growth. The future earnings for Apple are $6.58. That makes the forward P/E of $153/$6.58 
                              equals 23.25. The growth rate is the difference between the current earnings of $5.89 and $6.58 which 
                              is 11.7%. Paying a 23 P/E for a company growing at 11% growth seems very expensive to me.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              That is where we can adjust the P/E by the growth rate using another metric called Price to Earnings 
                              Growth (PEG) ratio. This takes the normal P/E and divides it further by the growth rate. We just 
                              calculated a forward P/E or 23 and growth rate of 11%. This is where we take the P/E and divide it by 
                              the growth rate or (23/11). That gives us a PEG ratio. In this case it is 2.09. The understanding for 
                              PEG ratio is that any company trading at less than 1 PEG ratio is very cheap. It's my experience that 
                              when a company has very high growth and the PEG is low, it is because investors do not trust the 
                              growth. When the PEG ratio is higher than 2, it is considered way too expensive. This can happen if 
                              the company has a very attractive dividend. Many companies like Apple here in our example are very 
                              expensive because they also have a dividend which gives them value above the level of growth in 
                              earnings. Many dividend companies will often trade at high PEG ratios as they have yield that supports 
                              the value where growth no longer exists. This is an example of classical Graham valuation, but what do 
                              you do when there is no earnings?
                         </p>
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Price to Sales Ratio</h3>
                         <p> 
                              Next I am going to look at a value metric for those kinds of companies. When a company has no 
                              Earnings, most investors will come up with all kinds of metrics to attempt to value them. I find the 
                              best metric is just Price to Sales. What is the Price to Sales ratio? This takes the Market Cap of 
                              the company and divides it by the total Revenues or Sales. In the Case of Apple it has a 2,400 billion 
                              market cap and 394 billion in sales. That makes the Price to Sales (2,400/394) or 6.09. I use P/S 
                              all the time in companies that don't have any earnings. You can even adjust this for growth like 
                              with the PEG ratio. Then I compare this with other companies in the sector and for the sector in 
                              general. There are sources on the internet where you can find the average Price to Sales ratio by 
                              industry. If your company is growing faster than the average company in the sector, then it's safe 
                              to assume it should have a higher Price to Sales ratio. The other thing to consider is profit 
                              margins. If 2 companies have the same sales, the one with a higher profit margin would get a higher 
                              valuation. I have seen this in healthy eating stocks in the past. When I had 2 companies with 
                              different Price to Sales ratio, the ones with higher growth and higher profit margins had a premium.   
                         </p>  
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Valuing Biotech</h3>
                         <p> 
                              My system for valuing biotech is something I developed over the years. I built this system to be an 
                              easy way to get a general ballpark valuation for a company so I can tell if it is overvalued or 
                              undervalued. I built it from years of watching how company's stocks respond to clinical data. The 
                              value a company loses or gains on a clinical data read out informs us to what the value was attributed 
                              to that program in the value of the stock. Then I have to assume 2 variables in this value. The first 
                              is the valuation takes into account the potential of the program. A program that could do $1 billion 
                              in sales would be worth more than one that could do $250 million in sales. The second assumption is 
                              the valuation takes in consideration the level of validation of the program. A phase 3 program is 
                              more validated than one in phase 1. It would have a bigger impact on valuation than a program in 
                              phase 1. If both these assumptions are true, then we can use the move in a company's stock price 
                              based on a clinical failure or success to inform us of the value.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              My model is a sum of the parts model. I take each drug in the pipeline and figure out what it could 
                              earn in revenues at peak sales. Then I adjust that value based on the level of validation of that drug. 
                              That gives me the value for that single drug. Then I add up all the value for all the programs and add 
                              in the cash. If I have a drug worth $500 million value, a second worth $250 million, and the company 
                              has $500 million cash, my valuation would be $500 million + $250 million + $500 million = $1.25 billion 
                              value.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The key values here are estimating peak sales and adjusting those sales based on the level of clinical 
                              validation. You can often get estimates for sales from analysts or even the company. The harder way is 
                              more accurate, but takes more time. If you follow your companies, they will often define for you the 
                              size of the patient population in their presentations. Then all you need to do is find prices of 
                              comparable drugs, and you can calculate peak sales. The only change would be to adjust for potential 
                              market share for competition. The level of validation for the drug would simply be the level of 
                              clinical success it has achieved. I take the peak sales and adjust them for the phase of development 
                              using .1x for preclinical, 1x for phase 1 data, 2x for phase 2 data, 3x for phase 3 data and 5x sales 
                              for a mature biotech valuation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once you have the value for each drug in the pipeline, you just add them up and add in the cash on the 
                              balance sheet. This will give you a total valuation for the company. You can compare the market cap 
                              you calculated to the current market cap to see if it is too expensive or too cheap. You can even 
                              adjust your valuation based on the outstanding shares and get a stock price for that valuation. Every 
                              time a company reports they will issue a 10Q or 10K. The very first page will list the number of 
                              outstanding shares at the time of reporting. You can divide your valuation by the shares outstanding 
                              and get a price target.

                         <p> 
                              Risk is the possibility of losing money in an investment. We can manage risk in our investments once 
                              we understand what it is and what kinds of risk there is around investing. Often just understanding 
                              the risks helps people better understand how they want to invest. I always use the expression of, 
                              “Manage the risks, and the rewards will take care of themselves”. I think I adapted this from 
                              something Warren Buffet once said. No truer words have been spoken. You can't make money unless you 
                              understand all the risks and how to mitigate them. You can't make money if you lose everything in 
                              one very speculative investment that fails.

                              How much risk you are willing to take comes down to two factors. The first is your personal tolerance 
                              for risk. Some people, like me, can put all their money in a bunch of risky speculative biotech 
                              companies and sleep like a baby. Other people get all nervous and can't sleep a wink if their 
                              portfolio goes even slightly into the red. I know a lot of people who say they can tolerate a ton 
                              of risk, but they freak out whenever something goes wrong with any of their companies. You have to 
                              honestly know how much risk you are comfortable with.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              You should never take any more risk than is necessary to achieve your long term goals. The market 
                              averages 8% a year over the long term. If you need more than that to reach your retirement goals, 
                              then you might need more risk. If you don't, then you can safely put your money into a low cost index 
                              fund and kick back. The amount of risk you want to assume depends on how much risk you can tolerate 
                              and how much risk you need to assume to meet your goals. I honestly believe that 90% of investors could 
                              contribute to a low cost index fund each pay day using a tax free account and do well over the long 
                              term.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The further you go out the risk spectrum while investing the bigger the reward, but so is the bigger 
                              risk of losing all your money. I see so many investors focus only on the rewards and never the risks. 
                              Each asset class has a different risk and reward level. Bonds typically have lower return rates around 
                              5% to 6% while having a lower risk. They will rarely move more than 10% in a year from highs to lows. 
                              Stocks will average 8% to 10% on average, but can swing more than 20% up or down in a single year. 
                              Asset allocation is a key principle of designing a portfolio to meet the highest possible return for 
                              the lowest possible risk an individual investor wants to assume.

                              There are different kinds of risks an investor will face while investing. Market risk always exists. 
                              This is the risk of the overall market having a crash or correction. Corrections and crashes happen 
                              all the time in the market. They can come from economic forces like a recession or geopolitical forces 
                              like an earthquake, pandemic or war. You can't control the events that cause market risk, and you 
                              don't know when they are going to strike. In the market we call them the Black Swan events. There are 
                              two main ways to protect yourself from the overall market risk. The first is you can hedge yourself. 
                              I have friends that sell covered calls or other options strategies to protect their investment in 
                              stocks from market risk. They earn extra money selling these calls when stocks are flat to going lower 
                              as the calls never get triggered. They take their own risk as a spike in the stock or market could end 
                              up with you getting “called” out of your stock, limiting your upside. The other is just to raise cash 
                              into big rallies for the market and buy back positions into the big crash or correction. That is my 
                              strategy. I tend to fade the rallies slowly as the stocks move higher. Then I slowly buy back my 
                              positions into a sell-off. I never go below a minimum position and never over a maximum position.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The other major risk is company specific risks. Anyone who has been in biotech for 5 seconds knows these 
                              all too well. They often come in the form of clinical failures, but there are many types of company 
                              risks. The biggest one is the risk of a poor management team. A poor management team can turn your 
                              investment life into a humbling experience. Taking a discovery stage biotech from start to commercial 
                              takes many important skills for a management team. Many of them are not up to that task. There are 
                              risks of patents, competition, obsolescence, failure to find funding, manufacturing and so many more.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Managing Risk</h3>
                         <p> 
                              The first thing new investors in biotech should figure out is what you are 
                              willing to lose. With a sector where 90% of the science fails, you have to have a high pain 
                              tolerance or a very good strategy. We will go with strategy because no one wants to endure a lot 
                              of pain. When it comes to science, we go through a lot of failures before we find great success. 
                              Hopefully, most of that is done in the early discovery phase before it comes into the clinical 
                              stage. Even so, many drugs still fail to ever reach commercial sales. We will look at strategies 
                              to limit the damage any single company can do while maximizing the returns each company can give 
                              us. For me, that level is 5%. I will risk up to 5% of my money on a speculative company. If I 
                              take that kind of loss, I know I can make up for it.

                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              Diversification is the best strategy for protecting yourself from single company risk. If you are 
                              diversified enough, it can also protect yourself from overall market risk as assets like bonds do well 
                              in bad markets while stocks do well in good markets and real estate does well with inflation. 
                              Spreading out your money is the best lesson any successful investor learns. Nothing is worse than 
                              going all in on a single company or asset and it fails miserably. You will always hear about that one 
                              guy who got rich going all in on a company, and it was a huge winner. What you never hear about is 
                              the 100 other people who go bankrupt from going all in on a company that fails. People who had all 
                              their money in companies like Enron and Worldcom know this lesson all too well. The first thing I 
                              recommend for new investors is figure out how much they can afford to lose in a single company. That 
                              becomes the limit they should use to put into any one company. I usually will go between 10 and 20 
                              companies depending on how much I want to risk in each. If you have 10 companies, that would limit 
                              each one to 10%. At 20 companies, that would limit each to 5%. How much money you concentrate in each 
                              company depends on how risky it is and how much risk tolerance you have.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some investors tend to put more into the companies that have big gains while limiting the newer 
                              companies that lack any real gains. Spreading out your money into more companies is the best way 
                              to protect it if one of those companies turns out to be the next Theranos. By setting a max limit 
                              on each company, it will protect you in case something goes wrong. I always tell myself, “If I am 
                              right about this company, it will come back”. Never throw good money after bad into an investment 
                              that isn't doing well. A max limit position prevents the desire to double down on bad companies.  
                              It is natural for an investor to dig in and insist they are right about a company. They will continue 
                              to throw good money after bad into a company as the stock goes lower. All they end up doing is 
                              amplifying the losses on a bad investment. Do not ever get into the habit of selling the winners to 
                              fund the losers. You end up with a portfolio full of tragedy. Setting a maximum limit on any 
                              position should be done even before you make the first buy. Once you have done all your research, 
                              you know how risky it is and how it fits into your overall strategy. Set those limits right away and 
                              stick to them.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Another good rule is don't buy all of your position at one time. In this day and age, you can trade for 
                              free at most brokers. There is no reason to be a hero and go all in with your max position right away. 
                              I usually make one buy early with a small position to get me in on the story. Then I wait for a 
                              correction in the stock to
                              build up my position. If you love the company now, you will really love it at a much cheaper price. Too 
                              many people go all in for their position right away. That is a very risky strategy as we often let 
                              emotion control our buying. We tend to chase stocks as they go higher because we want to get rich 
                              quick, and we panic sell them as they go lower because we can't stand the pain. Emotion is the challenge 
                              of a good investor. By nibbling away at a position over time, you can eliminate the emotions and make 
                              it a process.

                              The best investment in the world is the risk free investment. This comes by taking enough profits in a 
                              company to take out your costs. Then you can keep it forever if you want. I call this playing with the 
                              house's money. I get that question the most of any question I get from investors. It goes like this, “I 
                              bought XYZ company and it's up 300%, should I keep it or sell it?” My answer is always the same. I tell 
                              them to sell at least enough to take out their costs. Then they can let the rest run as long as they 
                              like the company. This allows us to take out our cost when things are bubbly so we don't lose money 
                              during the bust period. The one thing you can count on in biotech is there will be setbacks and 
                              struggles for every early stage company. Taking out your cost reduces your risk to zero. I tend to use 
                              a system of trading around my position to pay off my cost a little at a time. Once I reduce my cost 
                              basis to zero from capital gains, I can hold my shares at no risk to me. The biggest risk I have ever 
                              found in the markets is emotion. Things like fear and greed compel investors to do all the wrong things 
                              for all the wrong reasons and at the very worst time. Things like buying an exciting new biotech at the 
                              peak of euphoria right before it crashes back to reality. Fear will compel investors to sell a great 
                              company just because the stock is going lower right before a big buyout. The first thing a successful 
                              investor learns to do is to control their emotions with strategy and discipline.

                              When it comes to long term investing and planning, it is important to keep up with your portfolio 
                              periodically. If you are doing passive investing, you might just look at your investments annually 
                              to ensure they are keeping track with your long term goal. You can use an online investment 
                              calculator to figure out where you should be in your investment journey. If you are 5 years into 
                              saving for retirement, you can calculate where you should be to reach your final number for 
                              retirement. If you are falling behind or ahead, you can make adjustments. If I were ahead of the 
                              game, I would not adjust because if you reach your goal early, you can retire early. I would only 
                              take action if I were falling behind. This can happen because you chose a return of 10%, but you 
                              are only getting 8% in actuality. That is where managing your portfolio is important to making sure 
                              you are on track to reach your financial goals.

                         <p>
                              Rebalancing is a useful tool to maintain your investments. If you are using a good asset allocation, 
                              you will probably have periods where one investment is doing very well and another might not be doing 
                              so well. Typically, bonds do well when the economy is bad and the Fed is buying bonds. Stocks tend to 
                              do well when the market is booming. This can cause your asset allocation to shift. You have started 
                              with 30% bonds and 70% stock but now you are 27% bonds and 73% stocks. This is a good opportunity to 
                              rebalance by selling a bit of the stocks back down to 70% and buying some bonds back up to 30%. This 
                              can help you take profits in the assets that are doing well and add to assets that are cheap. I have 
                              looked at a few studies of rebalancing portfolios. It seemed the data showed that rebalancing too 
                              often caused underperformance while rebalancing once a year worked best. I think looking at your 
                              investments at least once a year and making sure you are on track for retirement and rebalancing if 
                              necessary is a good idea.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Dollar Cost Averaging</h3>
                         <p>
                              I think Dollar Cost Averaging is one of the best tools an active investor has at their disposal. 
                              In this day and age, we can trade stocks for free. Most brokers have completely eliminated 
                              trading fees. Back when I first started, you could expect to pay upward of $20 for a single 
                              trade. You were forced to buy as many shares as you could to spread the cost across as many shares 
                              as you could. Otherwise the fees alone would wipe out your gains, but that isn't a problem anymore. 
                              I still think some investors are stuck in that habit though. Today, we can buy just one share at a 
                              time if we wish. The only fees left are the few cents you pay for the SEC fee when you sell shares. 
                              The market is dominated with emotions. We as humans are ruled by our emotional behavior. We get 
                              excited when stocks are going up and we get scared when stocks are going down. Human behavior makes 
                              us want to buy at the worst time and sell at the worst time. By nibbling a specific amount of shares 
                              toward your position at intervals can take the emotion out of the equation. You might decide, I am 
                              going to buy $500 worth of shares of the VTI every month when I make my contribution to my IRA. That means 
                              you will buy the same dollar amount worth of shares every single month. You buy when the market is up and you 
                              buy when the market is down. This averages out your cost basis for your investment. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I like to use a different method of Dollar Cost Averaging. If I love a company, I will buy a small 
                              percentage of my position just to get into the company. Then I add a little to my position each time 
                              the stock pulls back at least 10% from my last purchase. For very volatile stocks like biotech, I 
                              would even use 20% for a gap in price between purchases. The goal is to try to get a cheaper price 
                              each time you buy. This ensures you are not chasing the euphoria of the market and only buying into 
                              the panic sell offs of the market. This can be a very difficult thing to do as every fiber of your 
                              being will scream for you to sell when you should be buying. I tend to automate the process. Most 
                              brokers will allow you to set Go to Canceled orders that will stay open for as long as you desire. If 
                              I start a position in a stock at $50, I might set up GTC orders for $45, $40, $35, $30, and $25 to 
                              reach my full position. Each one of these orders would trigger automatically when the price is 
                              reached. If the price isn't reached, then you don't worry about it. The biggest risk to this method is you 
                              want to pay attention to your companies. There is a risk that some really bad news happens and the stock 
                              crashes. You would end up with multiple bids triggering at the worst possible time. I don't mind buying a 
                              good company that gets taken down by the overall market, but I don't want to be buying a company that has 
                              failed in a massive way.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Trading Around a Core Position</h3>
                         <p>
                              Another method I use in combination with dollar cost averaging is trading around my core position. 
                              I make sure I keep at least 50% of my position for the long term investing. The other 50% I will 
                              use to trade around that core position. As the stock is pulling back, I will nibble some each time 
                              it reaches 10% or 20% down from my last purchase. When the stock returns to its old highs, I will 
                              begin to fade the trading shares down to my 50% core position taking profits each 20% the stock 
                              goes beyond the old high. Once I am down to my core position, I stop selling and wait for the next 
                              big correction or crash in the market to buy back my trading shares. This method allows me to take 
                              advantage of the bubble and bust mentality of the market to make more money and improve my 
                              returns. Any profits I take in capital gains, I use to lower my cost basis. My goal is to pay off 
                              my entire core position with the profits I make from trading. This lowers my cost basis to $0 and 
                              makes my investment on the house's money. That is the ultimate goal as you can own your investment 
                              at no cost to you.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Ranking Companies</h3>
                         <p>
                              Ranking companies is a principle of investing. It is an exercise I like to do with my companies from 
                              time to time by ranking them. I will go over each company and assess what I honestly think it has 
                              achieved compared to what I expected from that company. This is a fundamental evaluation of the 
                              company and how it has lived up to expectations. Often, I will find that some company has really 
                              disappointed me. Maybe management just didn't live up to expectations. Maybe the market wasn't as 
                              big as I thought. Maybe the data just didn't live up to expectations. No matter what went wrong, it 
                              is time to do an honest assessment of each company. I rank them into three groups of Buy, Hold and 
                              Sell. That means the companies I want to buy are the strongest companies, and I want more of them on 
                              any good sell off. The companies I rank as a hold have neither impressed or disappointed me. I am 
                              waiting for more development of those companies. I would be willing to buy more of them at the right 
                              price, but I would dedicate my cash to the buy stocks first. The sell ranked companies are those I 
                              would look to exit at the next available opportunity. There is no rush to sell those disappointing 
                              companies into a weak market. When the market comes back, so will the stock prices of the companies. 
                              That will allow you to sell them at a higher price when it's more to your advantage. I try to do this 
                              assessment at least once a year. I probably do it after each earnings season.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Selling Losers to Fund Winners</h3>
                         <p>
                              One of the worst habits I see investors fall into is selling their winners to buy more of their 
                              losers. This often stems from the inability to admit they got it wrong. The worst thing an investor 
                              can do is to sell companies that are doing well to buy more of those that are doing poorly. Yet, I 
                              would bet the vast majority of investors are doing this. They refuse to take losses or they refuse 
                              to admit they were wrong. They begin to sell the companies that are profitable to buy those that 
                              keep going down. Eventually, they end up with an entire portfolio of really bad companies. If you 
                              want to be a successful investor, you can't be afraid of taking a loss when it is necessary, and 
                              you can't dig in your heels and refuse to admit you might have gotten it wrong. I go into every 
                              investment assuming I could be completely wrong. When it comes to managing your investments, 
                              develop the healthy habit of selling your worst company to buy more of your best companies. I 
                              typically like to do this selling when the market is up so I can get a better price. This allows 
                              me to raise some cash. Then on the next big sell off, I can commit that capital into my buy ranked 
                              companies.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Wash Sale Rule</h3>
                         <p>
                              The wash sale rule states that, if you sell a stock for a loss, you can't buy back that stock for 30 
                              days or you wash that sale. That term wash means you can't claim it on your taxes. If I sold a stock 
                              and took a $5,000 loss, I can claim the loss on my taxes which helps me reduce my income for the year 
                              and lowers my tax burden. For example, If I make $100,000 a year, I have to pay taxes on that 
                              $100,000, but if I have a $5,000 loss from a stock, now I am only getting taxed as if I earned 
                              $95,000. Some people will actively do tax loss harvesting each year to sell their losers and use 
                              those losses to offset or reduce the tax burden they might have for their winners. The sale rule 
                              applies only if you plan to buy back that same company. Maybe you have a loss in Beam Therapeutics. 
                              In November, you decide to sell it and take the loss. Then you wait 30 days for the wash sale rule. 
                              You buy back the stock in January for a cheaper price. You used that loss to reduce your tax burned 
                              for the prior year. People who trade a lot really need to pay attention to the wash sale rule as they 
                              can end up buying back a stock before the wash sale rule has expired. If you are selling to get out 
                              and never return, then it is of no concern for you.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Managing Taxes</h3>
                         <p>
                              Managing taxes is one of the most important parts of investing. There are a lot of taxes that can be 
                              applied to capital gains on stocks. Short term gains of less than one year are considered earned 
                              income. They get taxed at your normal income tax bracket the same as if you earned them working. If 
                              you make $100,000 per year, your gains on stocks for short term capital gains will get taxed based on 
                              your tax bracket for $100,000 in income.  Any long term capital gains are taxed in a lower tax 
                              bracket like dividends. In our example, you would pay a 22% tax rate on short term capital gains and 
                              15% taxes on long term capital gains. That is a 7% difference just by holding for the long term. 
                              Understanding your tax bracket for both long and short term capital gains is important. The 
                              difference between long vs short term can be as high as 15% difference as the highest tax bracket is 
                              37% and the highest long term cap gain tax is 22%.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The best way to avoid taxes is to use a tax free account like a 401k or an IRA. These are a must for 
                              the retirement accounts. They allow you to compound your returns tax free for many years. You only 
                              pay taxes when you take the money out of these plans. Some of these plans allow you to pay taxes 
                              before so you don't have to pay them later like a Roth version of these accounts. The traditional 401k or IRA account 
                              means you put the money in before taxes and pay the taxes when you take it out in retirement. A Roth 
                              version of the 401k and IRA allows you to put the money in after you pay taxes so you don't have to 
                              pay taxes when you take it out in retirement. These are important points you have to evaluate when 
                              you are planning retirement. The drawback to these plans is you can't get the money out before you 
                              reach a certain age for retirement. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              If you are planning to invest money for something like a new house in 10 years, you don't want that 
                              in a retirement account which requires you to be age 65 to withdraw the money. You will have to use a 
                              taxable account for that kind of short term goal investing. There are some plans that allow you to 
                              take loans against your 401k or IRA so you can buy a house and things like that. These work great as 
                              you are not paying interest to a bank. You are paying it to your retirement as you pay back the loan. 
                              You are literally borrowing from yourself. This can be very useful. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Picking to go with a taxable vs a tax free account is one of the most important decisions you will 
                              make. You may end up using a combination of both for each of your short term and long term goals. 
                              Retirement should always be in a tax free account. Some of the short term goals may require a taxable 
                              account. There are two special types of short term tax free accounts with the 529 saving plan and a 
                              Health Savings Account (HSA). They allow you to put money into them after taxes and you don't pay 
                              taxes on withdrawals for qualified expenses. The 529 savings plan is for saving for a kids college 
                              and accumulates tax free and is tax free for qualified expenses like tuition and books. The HSA is 
                              for health care costs and allows you to put in money after taxes. It can accumulate tax free and cost 
                              no taxes for qualified health care expenses. They might be something of interest to you if they help 
                              fill one of your shorter term goals.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="speculation">Speculate Wisely</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Speculation is about investing in companies with high risk levels because they have very big 
                              potential. It can be an early stage technology company building electric cars or it could be an 
                              early stage biotech company working on gene editing. The thing that draws people to the market is 
                              that desire to pick a big winner that makes them rich. Speculation embraces that desire. It is the 
                              spice of investing. In moderation, it can make investing more exciting. When it is overused, it can 
                              be a recipe for disaster.  I embrace speculation in moderation. It makes investing fun and keeps 
                              you engaged. I think it is appropriate to do it in a taxable account with a small part of your 
                              investment money. We would call these discretionary portfolios. That is money we do not need for 
                              our long term goals, and it would not hurt us if we lost it all. My speculative portfolio is about 
                              10% of what my retirement is. That might seem like a lot, but I am already retired and I don't need 
                              the money for anything important. I have been able to use that to compound gains in these 
                              speculative portfolios over the long term.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Using Baskets</h3>
                         <p>
                              When it comes to speculation, I love to use baskets. A basket is a group of speculative stocks. It is 
                              basically a mini portfolio within your larger portfolio. The stocks in the basket can all have the same theme or 
                              the stocks could come from any sector or place. Let us assume I want to build a basket of CRISPR 
                              stocks. I decide I want to own 2% in 5 companies for 10% of my portfolio as my basket. I would pick 
                              5 companies, and I would own 2% of my total portfolio in each of them to make up my basket. When it 
                              comes to using a basket you are playing the odds. The odds are the vast majority of the companies 
                              will fail, but one or a few of them might be successful and one of them might even become a really 
                              big winner. Let us use an example. You picked 5 companies and put $1,000 in each.  The first 3 
                              companies fail and go bankrupt so you lose -$3,000. The 4th company doubled so you made $1,0000 profit. The 
                              last company goes up 10 fold so you make $9,000 profit. You have -$3000 + $2,000 + $10,000 as your final results.
                              That comes out to  $9,000 total of which you input $5,000 for the cost. That is $4,000 more than you 
                              initially invested or an 80% gain. That is the 
                              basic concept of basket investing to speculate. The goal is to have that 1 winner be a really huge 
                              winner. Maybe instead of doing 10x gain, it does a 1,000x gain like an Amazon. That is the whole 
                              principle of basket investing. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I use what I call the basket of baskets speculation system for my speculative investing. I do it in 
                              all my speculative portfolios with Technology, Biotechnology and Cryptocurrencies. In biotech, I pick 
                              key science themes I think will define the next decade of the sector. Then I find all the companies in 
                              that science field like CRISPR or TechBio. I will do my extensive due diligence on them and pick the 
                              top 4 or 5 companies. Then I build my basket using those top 4 or 5 companies I could find. I do the 
                              same thing in technology picking themes like Fintech and Electric Vehicles. Every basket I build in 
                              speculation has a key theme around some kind of technology I think could be a huge space in the future.
