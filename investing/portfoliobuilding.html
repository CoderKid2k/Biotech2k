                              Investing is the best way a person has to build their money over the long term. When you look at cash 
                              accounts like Saving, Money Markets and Certificates of Deposit, they pay less than 1% interest on 
                              average. You might get a few percent out of a CD. If you want to reach your long term financial goals, 
                              you will have to use investing where average returns can be between 6% and 10%. You can get more than 
                              that, but then you have to take on more risk. Investing requires risk, but without investing, you will 
                              never achieve those goals you want for the long term. If you put aside $500 per month for 40 years into 
                              a savings account, you might have about $295,000 in cash at 1% interest rates. That is never going to get you to your goals 
                              of retirement. If you put that same $500 into a tax free account like an IRA for 40 years at a 6% rate 
                              of return from stocks and bonds, you would have over $950,000. That is a massive difference of $700,000 
                              by taking on a bit more risk of investing. The amount of risk you are willing to take will vary from 
                              investor to investor.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="allocation">Asset Allocation</h2>
                         <p> 

                              Asset allocation is about picking the right types of investment to achieve your investment goals. 
                              There are a lot of different assets from Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities,  and Currencies. 
                              Each of these assets has a different risk and reward profile. Stocks tend to average about 10% 
                              annual over the long term. They can have big swings of upward of 20% in a single year, but the 
                              average is about 10% returns per year. The return is 10% and the risk is 20%. Bonds tend to return 
                              5% to 6% on average depending on the bonds. They tend to be less volatile with bonds moving about 
                              10% in the big swings. You have a lower return, but you also have lower risk. Other assets like 
                              Real Estate, Commodities and Currencies can be even more rewarding, but they bring with them more 
                              risk.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Know your Goals</h3>
                         <p>>
                              The most important thing to consider when you are starting to invest is what your goal is. I see a 
                              lot of investors who jump into investing with a get rich quick mentality. They have no plan and 
                              they tend to do poorly vs the average returns of the market. The first thing you need to know is 
                              what you want to achieve from investing. Most people will find they can reach all their goals with 
                              a simple diversified index fund. They don’t need to beat the market. They just need to perform 
                              inline with the market. That makes long term investing a very simple task for them as they can 
                              automate contributions and just track how things are going from time to time. If you are getting 
                              started later than other investors, you might have to play catch up. This might be a situation 
                              where you might embrace a bit more risk and use less bonds and more risky investments like stocks, 
                              real estate and commodities. Your goals will dictate what level of risk you need to take as an 
                              investor. You should never take on any more risk than you absolutely have to.
                         </p>  
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Types of assets</h3>
                         <p>
                              Bonds are owning debt. It can be debt of the Federal Government like Treasury Bonds, it can be debt of 
                              local and state authorities like Municipal Bonds, or it can be the debt of companies like Corporate 
                              Bonds. Each level of these bonds has different risks and rewards. The same theory applies. The more risk 
                              you assume the more reward you can get with bonds. Government Bonds are considered to be risk free as 
                              the government never fails to pay its bills. At least it hasn’t for the last 200 years. The returns on 
                              the treasury bond are typically the lowest. We often measure this by the 10 year yield for bonds which 
                              sits at 3.82%. That means you can already double or triple your return by own Treasury Bonds over a 
                              savings account. Municipal Bonds are from local and state governments. They do have risk as there have 
                              been some high profile bankruptcies from states and cities. Each of these bonds gets a credit rating 
                              from a ratings agency like S&P. You can use those ratings like triple A to find the highest quality 
                              Municipal Bonds. Many states allow you to earn income on these bonds tax free if you own Municipal 
                              bonds from your home state. The final type of bonds is corporate bonds. They are considered the most 
                              risky class of bond. There is a vast difference between corporate bonds with high quality companies 
                              like Apple and Junk Bond. Junk Bonds are what we call the bonds of the below investment grade ranked 
                              companies by the S&P ratings. Apple is rated at AA. Any bond over single triple B is considered 
                              investment grade. Below triple B is considered Junk Bonds.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Stocks are equity ownership in a company. We call them publicly owned companies. These companies are 
                              owned by shareholders who own tiny fractions of the overall company. A single share of the company 
                              entitles you to a share of the profits or losses of that company. You might not be able to build your 
                              own business, but you can own a tiny part of great companies like Apple or Amazon. Stocks are 
                              considered a more risky investment than bonds. They tend to average returns of 10% a year, but 
                              individual stocks can be very volatile. Apple might move 10% to 20% a year in stock price, but a 
                              speculative biotechnology or technology stock might swing 70% in a single year. Stocks are ownership 
                              in a company. That means you have the risk of what might happen to that company. Some companies go 
                              bankrupt. The best way to own stocks is by owning a large index of stocks to capture the average returns 
                              of the market without the individual risk of any one company.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Real Estate is owning property. Many of us already own a home. That is real estate. When it comes to 
                              investing, you might go out and buy up property and become a landlord or real estate expert. For the 
                              average investor, real estate will come from owning Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). These are 
                              large investing groups that pool together investor money by selling shares like stocks. They take all 
                              that money and they invest it into properties where they hire managers. Real estate tends to do well in 
                              inflationary and low interest rate environments as they borrow a lot of money to buy these properties so 
                              they have to pay interest on all those mortgages. The returns on real estate can be upward of 12% to 
                              14%, but then they can have higher volatility as they do well in low rates and poorly in high rates 
                              environments. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              Commodities is another asset class many investors like to own. These tend to act like a hedge since 
                              they often do well when investors panic. They tend to protect against inflation and do well as a hedge 
                              against the dollar. Many investors will insist on keeping at least 5% to 10% of their investments in 
                              commodities like Gold or Silver. You can do this by owning the physical asset like buying gold from a 
                              broker and keeping it in a safe at home. Many investors will own commodities like Oil, Gold and Silver 
                              through index funds. These are funds that pool together investor money and buy the physical assets and 
                              store them somewhere safe. They sell shares in that store of assets like they would a stock. The stock 
                              of those assets will fluctuate with the value of the underlying assets. They will buy or sell the 
                              assets in the warehouse based on investors buying or selling their stock.
                         </p>     
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Portfolio Theory and The Efficient Market Theory</h3>
                         <p>
                              Portfolio Theory is a fancy concept by which financial experts will design a portfolio of assets 
                              using mathematical formulas to achieve the perfect level of return for the level of risk each 
                              investor is comfortable with. Today, this can easily be done by AI and robo advisors. You can punch 
                              in your information to a robo advisor so it can determine what your financial goals are and what 
                              level of risk you are comfortable with. Then it actually picks a portfolio of assets for you to 
                              reach that perfect level of risk and reward. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The other concept is The Efficient Market theory which I subscribe to for the most part. This says 
                              that the millions of participants of the market are listening to all the news and taking into 
                              account all the facts. The market prices itself efficiently because the millions of participants 
                              are taking into account all the foreseen data around the economy and the market. I find this tends 
                              to be true for the overall market and it prices in all the news and events. I always say if you 
                              think you see something coming for the market, the market has already seen it and priced it into 
                              the price of the market. Where I find the market tends to fail to be efficient is in pricing 
                              individual companies. The market paints with a broad brush. If it likes oil and hates 
                              biotechnology, it will own all oil even the worst companies. It will in the same way dump all 
                              biotechnology companies including the best companies. This is where I have spent my 27 years of 
                              investing. I look for companies that are mispriced because their sector is currently hated by the 
                              market. Then I try to find and own the best companies in that sector as they will be cheap.

                              If you believe in efficient market theory, then you believe the average investor will never beat 
                              the market. The data supports this theory as less than 10% of active investors can actually 
                              outperform the market over a 5 year period. It shows about 20% can do it for a single year, but 
                              less than 10% can do it consistently. Those statistics are good enough for me. This means all you 
                              need to do is weight the market. What does that mean? If you are designing a portfolio which has 
                              an asset allocation of 60% stocks, then you just allocate that 60% to a low cost market index fund. 
                              This fund will give you the average performance of the market over time. An investor who believes 
                              in efficient market theory would just use a low cost index for bonds, stocks and commodities to 
                              reach their weighting for each asset. The term weight just means how much of an asset you own. If 
                              I own more Apple than I do Ford, then I am weighting Apple more than Ford.

                         <p>
                              So what is asset allocation? This is determining how much of each asset you are going to own in your 
                              portfolio. The classic portfolio of my childhood was you weighted bond to the same as your age then 
                              you filled the rest of your portfolio with stocks. If you are 25 and just getting started, you would 
                              own 25% bonds and 75% stocks. As you get older, you slowly shift the balance from the more risky, 
                              higher return stocks and toward the lower risk, lower return bonds. This ensures capital 
                              preservation as you approach retirement. This is an important term to understand in investing. When 
                              we invest money, there is a risk we can lose some or all of that initial investment. Companies 
                              default on bonds and go bankrupt. There is no risk free investment. Capital preservation is about 
                              reducing risk so you don't lose your input invested cash. As you get closer and closer to retirement, 
                              the desire to protect your money increases. The last thing you want is to reach a year from 
                              retirement and see all your stock collapse 30% right before you plan to retire. You might be forced 
                              to delay retirement.

                              Portfolio Theory now embraces all asset classes. There is a point where taking on some additional 
                              risk can help returns with very minimal impact to the risk profile while helping improve returns. 
                              Even adding a little bit of some super risky assets can add a bit of performance to a well allocated 
                              portfolio without ratcheting up the risk a whole lot. I have seen portfolio designs which showed 
                              adding a super speculative asset like crypto made for an efficiency portfolio. When it comes to 
                              portfolio theory, you will see the term efficiency frontier. This is a curve that shows various 
                              combinations of assets in various amounts and how they affect the risk and return of that portfolio.

                         <h3 class="sub-header" >Risk vs Reward</h3>
                         <p>
                              When it comes to investing, I find too many investors only focus on the rewards and dismiss the 
                              risk. They take way too much risk and end up underperforming the market. They would actually do 
                              better just owning the market using a low cost index fund. So what is this index fund I keep talking 
                              about? Index funds take money and they use it to buy stock, bonds, real estate or commodities using 
                              the same weightings as their respective market. A stock index would own all stocks and weigh them in 
                              that index based on the market size of each company. A mega company like Apple would be a large part 
                              of every index fund while a tiny company would have very little weight in that index. There are two 
                              types of index funds with mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF). The mutual fund will buy 
                              assets in weights equal to the market then they will sell shares in their fund to investors. These 
                              are called mutual funds. Some of them have high fees and many time requirements for ownership. The 
                              ETF takes the same approach where they sell shares in their fund and use that money to buy assets in 
                              equal weights to all the stocks in the market. They act very much like a stock of a company except 
                              you own all the companies in the market and not just one company. ETF are an excellent way to own an 
                              asset like stocks, bonds, real estate or commodities. Some of them are managed and they require more 
                              expenses which come out of the fund itself and lower returns. Others are designed to be low cost 
                              with minimal management as they just weigh an asset equal to the overall market. Some examples of 
                              good ETFs are like the SPY for the S&P 500. There is the VTI which mimics the overall market. There 
                              are bond ETFs like BND or HYG that own bonds. You can even own an EFT for Oil, Gold and Silver with 
                              USO, GLD or SLV. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              If you come up with an asset allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, you can do this by picking a low 
                              cost index fund or ETF that is offered in your 401k, IRA or self directed investment account. You can 
                              have an IRA with your broker and do asset allocation of 60% VIT  for stocks and 40% TLT for bonds. I 
                              have gone over 401k and IRA investments with many people. Every one of these company plans will have 
                              at least one low cost fund that will give you the exposure to the asset you want to meet your 
                              allocation to that asset. 
                         </p>

                              When in doubt, you should seek the advice of a professional. They go to school to learn how to 
                              efficiently build portfolios for each client based on their goals and risk appetite. You can do it 
                              yourself, but you might not have the most efficient portfolio you can have. Picking individual stocks 
                              I do not believe should be for most investors. I believe 90% of investors would do best to contribute 
                              every payday to your employer’s tax free investment account they offer you. You should allocate that 
                              money to funds that are low cost for the assets you chose to own. Stock picking is fun and it can be 
                              very enjoyable for many investors. I think it should be done in moderation especially for new 
                              investors.
