                              Investing is the best way a person has to build their money over the long term. When you look at cash 
                              accounts like Saving, Money Markets and Certificates of Deposit, they pay less than 1% interest on 
                              average. You might get a few percent out of a CD. If you want to reach your long term financial goals, 
                              you will have to use investing where average returns can be between 6% and 10%. You can get more than 
                              that, but then you have to take on more risk. Investing requires risk, but without investing, you will 
                              never achieve those goals you want for the long term. If you put aside $500 per month for 40 years into 
                              a savings account, you might have about $295,000 in cash at 1% interest rates. That is never going to get you to your goals 
                              of retirement. If you put that same $500 into a tax free account like an IRA for 40 years at a 6% rate 
                              of return from stocks and bonds, you would have over $950,000. That is a massive difference of $650,000 
                              by taking on a bit more risk of investing. The amount of risk you are willing to take will vary from 
                              investor to investor.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="allocation">Asset Allocation</h2>
                         <p> 

                              Asset allocation is about picking the right types of investment to achieve your investment goals. 
                              There are a lot of different assets from Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities,  and Currencies. 
                              Each of these assets has a different risk and reward profile. Stocks tend to average about 10% 
                              annual over the long term. They can have big swings of upward of 20% in a single year, but the 
                              average is about 10% returns per year. The return is 10% and the risk is 20%. Bonds tend to return 
                              5% to 6% on average depending on the bonds. They tend to be less volatile with bonds moving about 
                              10% in the big swings. You have a lower return, but you also have lower risk. Other assets like 
                              Real Estate, Commodities and Currencies can be even more rewarding, but they bring with them more 
                              risk.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Know your Goals</h3>
                         <p>
                              The most important thing to consider when you are starting to invest is what your goal is. I see a 
                              lot of investors who jump into investing with a get rich quick mentality. They have no plan and 
                              they tend to do poorly vs the average returns of the market. The first thing you need to know is 
                              what you want to achieve from investing. Most people will find they can reach all their goals with 
                              a simple diversified index fund. They don’t need to beat the market. They just need to perform 
                              inline with the market. That makes long term investing a very simple task for them as they can 
                              automate contributions and just track how things are going from time to time. If you are getting 
                              started later than other investors, you might have to play catch up. This might be a situation 
                              where you might embrace a bit more risk and use less bonds and more risky investments like stocks, 
                              real estate and commodities. Your goals will dictate what level of risk you need to take as an 
                              investor. You should never take on any more risk than you absolutely have to.
                         </p>  
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Types of assets</h3>
                         <p>
                              Bonds are owning debt. It can be debt of the Federal Government like Treasury Bonds, it can be debt of 
                              local and state authorities like Municipal Bonds, or it can be the debt of companies like Corporate 
                              Bonds. Each level of these bonds has different risks and rewards. The same theory applies. The more risk 
                              you assume the more reward you can get with bonds. Government Bonds are considered to be risk free as 
                              the government never fails to pay its bills. At least it hasn’t for the last 200 years. The returns on 
                              the treasury bond are typically the lowest. We often measure this by the 10 year yield for bonds which 
                              sits at 3.82%. That means you can already double or triple your return by own Treasury Bonds over a 
                              savings account. Municipal Bonds are from local and state governments. They do have risk as there have 
                              been some high profile bankruptcies from states and cities. Each of these bonds gets a credit rating 
                              from a ratings agency like S&P. You can use those ratings like triple A to find the highest quality 
                              Municipal Bonds. Many states allow you to earn income on these bonds tax free if you own Municipal 
                              bonds from your home state. The final type of bonds is corporate bonds. They are considered the most 
                              risky class of bond. There is a vast difference between corporate bonds with high quality companies 
                              like Apple and Junk Bonds. Junk Bonds are what we call the bonds of the below investment grade ranked 
                              companies by the S&P ratings. Apple is rated at AA. Any bond over triple B is considered 
                              investment grade. Below triple B is considered Junk Bonds.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Stocks are equity ownership in a company. We call them publicly owned companies. These companies are 
                              owned by shareholders who own tiny fractions of the overall company. A single share of the company 
                              entitles you to a share of the profits or losses of that company. You might not be able to build your 
                              own business, but you can own a tiny part of great companies like Apple or Amazon. Stocks are 
                              considered a more risky investment than bonds. They tend to average returns of 10% a year, but 
                              individual stocks can be very volatile. Apple might move 10% to 20% a year in stock price, but a 
                              speculative biotechnology or technology stock might swing 70% in a single year. Stocks are ownership 
                              in a company. That means you have the risk of what might happen to that company. Some companies go 
                              bankrupt. The best way to own stocks is by owning a large index of stocks to capture the average returns 
                              of the market without the individual risk of any one company.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Real Estate is owning property. Many of us already own a home. That is real estate. When it comes to 
                              investing, you might go out and buy up property and become a landlord or real estate expert. For the 
                              average investor, real estate will come from owning Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). These are 
                              large investing groups that pool together investor money by selling shares like stocks. They take all 
                              that money and they invest it into properties where they hire managers. Real estate tends to do well in 
                              inflationary and low interest rate environments as they borrow a lot of money to buy these properties so 
                              they have to pay interest on all those mortgages. The returns on real estate can be upward of 12% to 
                              14%, but then they can have higher volatility as they do well in low rates and poorly in high rates 
                              environments. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              Commodities is another asset class many investors like to own. These tend to act like a hedge since 
                              they often do well when investors panic. They tend to protect against inflation and do well as a hedge 
                              against the dollar. Many investors will insist on keeping at least 5% to 10% of their investments in 
                              commodities like Gold or Silver. You can do this by owning the physical asset like buying gold from a 
                              broker and keeping it in a safe at home. Many investors will own commodities like Oil, Gold and Silver 
                              through index funds. These are funds that pool together investor money and buy the physical assets and 
                              store them somewhere safe. They sell shares in that store of assets like they would a stock. The stock 
                              of those assets will fluctuate with the value of the underlying assets. They will buy or sell the 
                              assets in the warehouse based on investors buying or selling their stock.
                         </p>     
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Portfolio Theory and The Efficient Market Theory</h3>
                         <p>
                              Portfolio Theory is a fancy concept by which financial experts will design a portfolio of assets 
                              using mathematical formulas to achieve the perfect level of return for the level of risk each 
                              investor is comfortable with. Today, this can easily be done by AI and robo advisors. You can punch 
                              in your information to a robo advisor so it can determine what your financial goals are and what 
                              level of risk you are comfortable with. Then it actually picks a portfolio of assets for you to 
                              reach that perfect level of risk and reward. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The other concept is The Efficient Market theory which I subscribe to for the most part. This says 
                              that the millions of participants of the market are listening to all the news and taking into 
                              account all the facts. The market prices itself efficiently because the millions of participants 
                              are taking into account all the foreseen data around the economy and the market. I find this tends 
                              to be true for the overall market and it prices in all the news and events. I always say if you 
                              think you see something coming for the market, the market has already seen it and priced it into 
                              the price of the market. Where I find the market tends to fail to be efficient is in pricing 
                              individual companies. The market paints with a broad brush. If it likes oil and hates 
                              biotechnology, it will own all oil even the worst companies. It will in the same way dump all 
                              biotechnology companies including the best companies. This is where I have spent my 27 years of 
                              investing. I look for companies that are mispriced because their sector is currently hated by the 
                              market. Then I try to find and own the best companies in that sector as they will be cheap.

                              If you believe in efficient market theory, then you believe the average investor will never beat 
                              the market. The data supports this theory as less than 10% of active investors can actually 
                              outperform the market over a 5 year period. It shows about 20% can do it for a single year, but 
                              less than 10% can do it consistently. Those statistics are good enough for me. This means all you 
                              need to do is weight the market. What does that mean? If you are designing a portfolio which has 
                              an asset allocation of 60% stocks, then you just allocate that 60% to a low cost market index fund. 
                              This fund will give you the average performance of the market over time. An investor who believes 
                              in efficient market theory would just use a low cost index for bonds, stocks and commodities to 
                              reach their weighting for each asset. The term weight just means how much of an asset you own. If 
                              I own more Apple than I do Ford, then I am weighting Apple more than Ford.

                         <p>
                              So what is asset allocation? This is determining how much of each asset you are going to own in your 
                              portfolio. The classic portfolio of my childhood was you weighted bonds to the same as your age then 
                              you filled the rest of your portfolio with stocks. If you are 25 and just getting started, you would 
                              own 25% bonds and 75% stocks. As you get older, you slowly shift the balance from the more risky, 
                              higher return stocks and toward the lower risk, lower return bonds. This ensures capital 
                              preservation as you approach retirement. This is an important term to understand in investing. When 
                              we invest money, there is a risk we can lose some or all of that initial investment. Companies 
                              default on bonds and go bankrupt. There is no risk free investment. Capital preservation is about 
                              reducing risk so you don't lose your input invested cash. As you get closer and closer to retirement, 
                              the desire to protect your money increases. The last thing you want is to reach a year from 
                              retirement and see all your stocks collapse 30% right before you plan to retire. You might be forced 
                              to delay retirement.

                              Portfolio Theory now embraces all asset classes. There is a point where taking on some additional 
                              risk can help returns with very minimal impact to the risk profile while helping improve returns. 
                              Even adding a little bit of some super risky assets can add a bit of performance to a well allocated 
                              portfolio without ratcheting up the risk a whole lot. I have seen portfolio designs which showed 
                              adding a super speculative asset like crypto made for an efficient portfolio. When it comes to 
                              portfolio theory, you will see the term efficiency frontier. This is a curve that shows various 
                              combinations of assets in various amounts and how they affect the risk and return of that portfolio.

                         <h3 class="sub-header" >Risk vs Reward</h3>
                         <p>
                              When it comes to investing, I find too many investors only focus on the rewards and dismiss the 
                              risk. They take way too much risk and end up underperforming the market. They would actually do 
                              better just owning the market using a low cost index fund. So what is this index fund I keep talking 
                              about? Index funds take money and they use it to buy stock, bonds, real estate or commodities using 
                              the same weightings as their respective market. A stock index would own all stocks and weigh them in 
                              that index based on the market size of each company. A mega company like Apple would be a large part 
                              of every index fund while a tiny company would have very little weight in that index. There are two 
                              types of index funds with mutual funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF). The mutual fund will buy 
                              assets in weights equal to the market then they will sell shares in their fund to investors. These 
                              are called mutual funds. Some of them have high fees and many have time requirements for ownership. The 
                              ETF takes the same approach where they sell shares in their fund and use that money to buy assets in 
                              equal weights to all the stocks in the market. They act very much like a stock of a company except 
                              you own all the companies in the market and not just one company. ETFs are an excellent way to own an 
                              asset like stocks, bonds, real estate or commodities. Some of them are managed and they require more 
                              expenses which come out of the fund itself and lower returns. Others are designed to be low cost 
                              with minimal management as they just weigh an asset equal to the overall market. Some examples of 
                              good ETFs are like the SPY for the S&P 500. There is the VTI which mimics the overall market. There 
                              are bond ETFs like BND or HYG that own bonds. You can even own an EFT for Oil, Gold and Silver with 
                              USO, GLD or SLV. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              If you come up with an asset allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, you can do this by picking a low 
                              cost index fund or ETF that is offered in your 401k, IRA or self directed investment account. You can 
                              have an IRA with your broker and do asset allocation of 60% VIT  for stocks and 40% TLT for bonds. I 
                              have gone over 401k and IRA investments with many people. Every one of these company plans will have 
                              at least one low cost fund that will give you the exposure to the asset you want to meet your 
                              allocation to that asset. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When in doubt, you should seek the advice of a professional. They go to school to learn how to 
                              efficiently build portfolios for each client based on their goals and risk appetite. You can do it 
                              yourself, but you might not have the most efficient portfolio you can have. Picking individual stocks 
                              I do not believe should be for most investors. I believe 90% of investors would do best to contribute 
                              every payday to your employer's tax free investment account they offer you. You should allocate that 
                              money to funds that are low cost for the assets you chose to own. Stock picking is fun and it can be 
                              very enjoyable for many investors. I think it should be done in moderation especially for new 
                              investors.

                              Now we are going to start to look at strategies to build a portfolio of investments. This will be 
                              about picking individual stocks, bonds, REITs or commodity indexes to reach our investment goals. 
                              If you have 60% of your assets in stocks, you may choose to pick individual companies. In that 
                              case, you will need additional strategies to help protect you from the risks and maximize the 
                              return. This can be things like using diversification to spread out risk over many companies. It 
                              can be using sector allocations to take advantage of some sectors doing well during good periods of 
                              the economy and other sectors doing well in weaker periods of the economy. It can use strategies like 
                              weighting some companies more than others as they are safer or provide a desired return. There is 
                              a lot of planning that can go into building a portfolio that performs to the return you like for a 
                              level of risk you are comfortable with.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Active vs Passive Investing</h3>
                         <p>
                              Up till now we talked about passive investing and how to allocate capital using investments that 
                              mimic the overall market or the asset class they are designed to track. Passive investing works for 
                              millions of investors who want to invest to meet their long term goals. Active investing appeals 
                              to a lot of investors who want to pick stocks. There is something fun and exciting about picking 
                              stocks for yourself. The truth is most active investors never beat the market. If you are going to 
                              pick stocks yourself, you should accept the fact you might underperform the overall market. I think 
                              active investing for a small part of a bigger asset allocation might be best for many investors. 
                              This gives you a small portfolio to dabble while keeping the vast majority of your investment in 
                              assets that will perform as expected. I have a few portfolios that I have developed for active 
                              investing that I call discretionary portfolios. They are built from funds I do not need or would 
                              not matter if they are lost. They don’t count for my retirement. That is often the best way to 
                              start with active investing. 
                         </p>
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Trading vs Investing</h3>
                         <p>
                              I would bet that the vast majority of the market today is short term trading. Most investing funds 
                              and active investors today do trading based on technical indicators of some kind. This involves 
                              charts and other indicators such as trend or volume. I have never gotten into trading, but the 
                              statistics suggest the vast majority of traders do not outperform the market. When everyone is 
                              looking at the same charts and the same patterns, trading often becomes a game of the herd chasing the 
                              same trade. I call it the momentum trade. Everyone buys as long as the chart is strong and everyone
                              sells as long as the chart is weak. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Investing is about finding great companies with strong fundamentals and buying their stock for the 
                              long term. It is about ownership in a company and its products or services. Investing doesn’t have 
                              much concern with the short term moves of the market or the economy. For an investor, weakness in 
                              the economy or the market overall is an opportunity to buy more stock at a cheaper price. From here 
                              on out, we will solely focus on strategies for investors with few exceptions. I tend to be a long 
                              term investor, but I like to trade around my positions from time to time to take profits and buy 
                              back cheaper.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Diversification</h3>
                         <p>
                              Diversification is the first tool and most powerful tool of the investor. It is about spreading 
                              around your money so that any one company does not make up too much of your portfolio. I have seen 
                              a lot of investors go all in on one company. Sometimes it is a successful company and they do very 
                              well. This is an extremely dangerous way to invest. All you have to do is ask the investors who bet 
                              everything on companies like Enron or Theranos. Diversification is the most powerful tool an 
                              investor has against risk of single company ownership. In the same way we would own different assets 
                              to help protect against market risk, diversification helps protect against single company risk.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are different levels of diversification. Some people will tell you it is fine to own just a 
                              handful of stocks with a larger percentage of your money in each stock. Others will say you should 
                              own a bunch of companies to spread out the risk. I think that depends on each person. The more 
                              companies you own, the more work you will have to do to keep up with them all. The more companies 
                              you own the more work you have to put into investing. Time is a resource that will be important in 
                              determining how diversified you can be. The type of companies you own will matter. If you are 
                              picking large companies that are stable like Apple or Amazon, you could  have few companies with 
                              bigger positions. If you are picking a lot of small companies with a high level of risk, then maybe 
                              you want to spread out your investments across many more companies.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I tend to dabble in the most risky parts of the market like small cap technology, small cap 
                              biotechnology and crypto. This means I like to really spread things out as the risk of failure is 
                              also high. I used to do at least 10 companies and around 10% in each company. That worked fine, but 
                              losing 10% when a company goes bad was more than I was happy with losing. Over time I added more 
                              companies until I reached around 20. That gives me 5% or less in each company. That is a very 
                              acceptable level of loss should something go wrong. That is what I am comfortable with. You will 
                              have to decide for yourself based on what kind of companies you own, how much time you have and what 
                              level of risk you are comfortable with.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Sector Allocation</h3>
                         <p>
                              Sector allocation is another important part of diversification. Not every sector does well at the 
                              same time during any economy. Some sectors hold up well during bad times and might even do better in 
                              a weak economy. We call them the consumer staples. They are the things people can not live without regardless 
                              of how the economy is doing. They are things like food and drug stocks along with utilities. They 
                              have stable earnings no matter what economy we are in. They tend to do well in a weak economy and 
                              poorly when the economy is strong.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Other sectors tend to be very strong when the economy is roaring. They tend to be the companies that 
                              make more money when people have more money to spend like retail, industrials and consumer 
                              discretionary sectors. We call these sectors of the economy the cyclical sectors as they will do well 
                              at one part of the economic cycle and poorly at another part of the economic cycle. There are some 
                              sectors we call secular sectors. They don't move with the economy, but tend to have their own cycles 
                              where there is a boom and bust. Things like telecom and technology tend to have their own cycles 
                              depending on rollouts of new technology in development.

                              Spreading your money across multiple sectors allows you to ensure you have at least something that is 
                              doing well no matter what part of the economic cycle we are in. When I was a young investor, I had a 
                              set of sectors that I would always own because they gave me broad coverage of the economic cycle. I 
                              always had an Oil company, Bank, Industrial, Telecom and a Utility at the least. If we were in the 
                              upcycle, I would add more of the sectors like retail and consumer discretionary. In the down part of 
                              the cycle, I would add more of the steady dividend stocks like food and drug stocks.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Weighting</h3>
                         <p>
                              This is about how much of a stock you own. We call it the weighting of the stock in the portfolio. 
                              Some investors will weigh every company equally. This is how I do it on my cost basis. I will buy up 
                              to an equal weight of a stock based on what I pay for it. I own about the same amount for each 
                              company. Some I will own more as I like them more while others I will own less as I don't have as 
                              much conviction in them. My max weight for a company is around 5% of my portfolio. Some of them are 
                              a bit more and several of them have less than that amount. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some investors will weigh their companies by the level of conviction they have in them. They will have 
                              larger amounts of the companies they love and less of the companies they don't have as much conviction 
                              in. They might own 10% or 20% in one company they believe in the most and a few others they only own a 
                              few percent in like 5% in a few other companies they think might be great in that space. I think 
                              this is a good strategy when the big weighted companies are big cap safer companies. Sometimes 
                              investors will have a large weighting in a company that is very speculative which then makes this 
                              strategy more risky. Regardless of which strategy you use, you will have to consider how much weight 
                              you will give each company in your portfolio.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Value vs Growth</h3>
                         <p>
                              Value investing is about finding companies that look cheap based on their assets or cash flows. It has 
                              metrics like a price to earning ratio, margins, cash flows and assets. I spent many years as a value 
                              investor looking for companies that were beaten down and trading at a discount to their intrinsic 
                              value. The value investor is looking for companies that are trading at a discount to their intrinsic 
                              value based on some macroeconomic forces or because the company might be facing some challenges. Many 
                              large companies in the market will fall into the value category. Most of them have low growth rates 
                              and are fully mature companies. The key to the value investor is about finding the companies which are 
                              trading as a discount and holding them until the market values them correctly. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Growth investing is all about the future. Many growth companies are in their early years of startup 
                              and many are not even profitable yet. They receive revenues, but they don't have any profits as they 
                              spend more than they make to drive growth. For the growth investor, it is all about what the company 
                              will become in the future. This makes growth investing very risky as some of these companies will not 
                              be successful. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I find that investors will typically be drawn to one type of these investments or the other. I rarely 
                              find an investor which will do both value and growth investing. Most investors will end up falling in 
                              love with one type or other. Some will love the treasure hunt of investing in growth companies while 
                              others will find value metrics to be more their thing. It is my belief that owning value is the same 
                              as owning the market and I would just use an index. I am a growth investor. I only like to pick 
                              individual companies that I think will become a huge success someday. That means I take on a lot of 
                              risk, but I only do so in my discretionary portfolios where I can afford the losses. I use a ton of 
                              risk mitigation strategies to ensure I don't lose a lot of money. That probably costs me something on 
                              the big winners when I hit on them, but it is worth the trade off as the failure rate in early stage 
                              companies is very high.

                         <p> 
                              Now I am going to share with you how I do my due diligence for companies. This is just my method. I 
                              am sure everyone else has their own. I tend to spend a lot of time getting to know a company very 
                              well. I like to follow them and get a good feel for the company and the management team. I am never 
                              in a hurry when shopping for a new company. I make sure I take my time and do all the work before I 
                              start to buy. Then I start by buying a tiny position to get started. I will nibble away at the 
                              position over time as I get more and more familiar with the company and confident in my investment. 
                              If at any time I start to doubt, I stop buying so that my position doesn’t get bigger. This often 
                              stops me from taking a full position in a company that I will end up selling later once my concern 
                              comes about. 
                         </p>
                         <h3 class="sub-header">Macro is a Backdrop</h3>
                         <p> 
                              When it comes to picking a good long term investment, I find too many investors get distracted by 
                              the macroeconomic backdrop. They let a down market dissuade them from buying a great long term 
                              investment. The negative sentiment causes them to not buy when the price is actually at its 
                              cheapest. The economy has its boom and its bust periods. The good news is the bust persiods typically last one to 
                              two years. The booms can last for many years or even a decade. Taking advantage of a weak market or 
                              economic backdrop is actually the best asset of a long term investor. There should be no reason 
                              a recession today or next year would stop you from owning a company you think could be worth 10 
                              times this value in another 10 or 20 years. Yet, no matter how many times I try to teach investors 
                              this concept, they still get hung up in the panic and fear of a down market.

                         <p>  
                              If you really love investing and picking companies, then you should desire to know everything you 
                              can about them. No one should know more about your companies than you. Obviously, the management 
                              and insiders will always be privy to information no one else has. No other investor should know 
                              something that is publicly available information and you do not know it. This means you have to 
                              spend a lot of time digging through financial reports, presentations, publications and listening 
                              to webcasts. The only competitive advantage vs other investors you have is knowledge. You should 
                              know every partnership, every lawsuit, every data read out and the amount of sales each company 
                              has. Here I am going to share with you my system for doing research on companies before I ever make 
                              a purchase.

                         <p>     
                              The first thing I will do for a company that is new to me is look over their science. I know the 
                              science and I know what looks like it could work and what looks like it could have problems. I 
                              really need to see how the science works and what the data looks like before I decide if it can be a 
                              huge winner or a struggling science concept. If the company has recently gone public, they will 
                              have a recently published S-1 which is put out ahead of the IPO. These usually go very in depth 
                              into the science of the company. If the company is within a few years of the IPO, I will go back 
                              and find the S-1 and go through the science to see if it has any issues or problems. Any company 
                              that is at least a year old will have published an annual report 10K. This is a very in depth 
                              document like the S-1 and gets published each year. I am going to read that and make sure I am 
                              up to date on any data that might have come out since the S-1. Then I check the quarterly report 
                              10Q to ensure  I have the latest data possible. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next thing I really want to look at for a company is the Indications and how big they are. 
                              Small indications make small profits while big indications make big profits. This is important to 
                              the long term success of the company. I want to know if there are any partners and how they take 
                              off the sales of any product. I want to really know the financial terms. There is no point to 
                              owning a company if you don’t know what it could be worth in 10 years. The only way to do that is 
                              to look at its pipeline and figure out what it can earn in revenues and then figure out what those 
                              revenues can be worth.
                         </p>

                              You might say, what about management? What about them? The only way to really know a management 
                              team is to follow them over time and see how well they do. This is the hardest part of any 
                              investment as management can make or break the best companies. It is never something you are going 
                              to read in a 500 page document. It can only be determined by watching how a management team handles 
                              its affairs for presentations, financial management, navigating the regulatory process and building 
                              the company.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Press Releases</h3>
                         <p> 
                              I like to go through the press releases of the company. If it is a younger company, I tend to start 
                              at the very first press release and go through them in chronological order. This gives me a very 
                              good feel of the news and events in actual time. I can see what decisions the company has made for 
                              its programs and finances and build a picture of how well they are developing the company over time. 
                              I tend to go through at least 3 years of press releases, but I will often start at the beginning 
                              and skim through them all for a company that is new to me.

                         <h3 class="sub-header">Webcast Conferences</h3>
                         <p>
                              When it comes to getting to know management, nothing helps better than listening to them present 
                              and speak. You can get a good feel for how they handle themselves. You can tell if they make hyped 
                              up claims to pump the company. This is distasteful as many of the management teams that resort to 
                              hype do so as they lack real sustenance. I can tell if a CEO delegates by allowing his other team 
                              members to take charge of their respective fields like finance or science. A CEO that dominates 
                              and doesn’t delegate worries me. I can tell if the CEO knows science or is a finance professional. 
                              Both can do well, but they need to know both skills or be willing to delegate those areas to 
                              someone who does. A business person CEO teamed with a great science CSO often does really well. 
                              You can get to know a management team and how proficient at their job they are by just listening 
                              to how they present over time. I will often go through at least a year's worth of webcasts if they 
                              are available. That gets me a few earnings calls and several science conferences if I am lucky. If 
                              a company doesn’t have those webcasts then I will follow them in real time until I hear enough to 
                              feel comfortable with the management team. It just takes longer.

                              I like to go through the posters, publications and presentations. Not every company will have a 
                              page of their website where they put publications, but I find I am more confident in the companies 
                              that share this data. The publications are data that is published in various journals or at science 
                              meetings. I will also go through the slide decks from the company. Some companies will put out a 
                              slide deck every month. These can often give very useful data about the indications, their size, 
                              the competition and potential.

                              Once I have done all my initial due diligence, I don’t just stop there. I keep up with all these 
                              events. I usually pick one weekend a month where I will go through all the press releases, events, 
                              slide decks and SEC filings for each company I own. It has been so important to me, that I put all 
                              these links on every company’s profile on this website. This saves me a huge amount of time trying 
                              to go to the website of each company one at a time and find the information. You should get to know
