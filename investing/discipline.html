                         <p> 
                              When it comes to staying disciplined to my strategy, I love to make up rules. I love to give them
                              catch names that makes them easy to remember.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              1/Don't Put All Your Eggs in One Basket
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is probably a rule everyone has heard about in investing. It is the rule about being diversified and 
                              not putting all my money into one company or one investment. This rule is about managing my risk in case 
                              one company becomes the next Theranos. I know some poeple 
                              will put more money in companies they have the highest conviction in and less money in those companies they 
                              find more risky. I tend to do things different. I like to risk a little to make a lot. I don't have to swing for 
                              the fences with every pitch. I tend to have at least 10 companies and like to have about 20 so I am not putting
                              more that 5% in a single company.
                         </p>   
                         <p>
                              2/Gambling is for Vegas
                         </p>    
                         <p>
                              One of the biggest risks I see in the market is the Get Rich Quick mentality. I have never seen anyone
                              get rich quick, but I have seen a lot of people get wiped out in a flash. When it comes to investing, I do 
                              not gamble. I do not go all in on one highly speculative company no matter how much I believe in it. I 
                              don't play binary events like clincal readouts. I don't use margin and I don't play options. I tend to use 
                              a very simple strategy of value investing. If I want to gamble, I will go to Vegas where its is far more 
                              fun and entertaining. I know a lot of people think investing is gambling, but its not. You have information 
                              and data in investing that allows you to make educted decisions about companies. Not getting swept up in the 
                              Fear of Missing out or euphoria of the market is a discipline of its own.
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              3/Never Risk more than You can Afford to Lose
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              I mentioned this before in the right sizing of investment positions. 
                              I can't tell you how many people I come across that are all in on 1 company or 1 investment. It blows my mind 
                              that they are so confident to lose all their money if one event happens that disrupts that investment. Diversification
                              goes hand in hand with Position Sizing. People who are retired should not be 80% in speculative biotech or some 
                              new fad crypto coin.
                              I see way too many investor who focus only on the reward and completely dismiss the risk. I go by the idea of manage 
                              the risk and the rewards will take care of themselves. I never risk more than 5% of my own money on any single company.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              4/The Starship Trooper Rule
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is one of my favorite rules. It comes from the movie where the capatian says, "The job is yours 
                              until you die or I find better". This rule is important to remember when investing. Its about keeping good 
                              companies for as long as they remain good companies. I see too many investors turn an investment into a 
                              trade. They buy a company and it pops 50%. They sell it all. Then they miss out on the next 300% it goes 
                              up because they had the investment right, but they sold it for a trade. I never sell out of a company unless 
                              if fails or I find better. This rule keeps me in the winners for the long term.
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              5/The 3 Stooges Rule
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              This rule is about the value of management. Watching some companies management is like watching an episode 
                              of the 3 Stooges. It would actually be funny if it were not losing investors money. I will never own a company were
                              I have any doubts about the management. I will often sell a company should the management change. That depends 
                              on my position and my belief in the previous management. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              6/I Would Rather Pay up for Success than be Overweight Failure
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is my key rule for biotech investing. Many investors will expect everything to go right for their 
                              highly speculative company. They will buy a big position into data expecting a good read out. Any failure 
                              costs them a ton of money. I tend to reward success. I like to keep my positions small and buy more of companies 
                              that have good data while avoiding the ones that have bad data. That develops my portoflio naturally to be 
                              weighted to the winners. These companies have a long road to commercial success. Waiting for the data might 
                              miss a quick pop, but it will be far from over.
                         </p>

                              7/The Kenny Roger Rule
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              You got to know when to hold them and know when to fold them. This rules is about being truthful with myself
                              and admitting I got a company wrong. This rule allows me to get rid of the bad companies before they turn little
                              losses into big losses. Sometimes, getting out of a company isn't about them going bad. Sometimes the company 
                              has just fully matured. This is when the company's future does not seem like it could drive a much higher 
                              valuation. I can think of a few companies that reached a point where I could not see a future that was brighter 
                              than their past. They were fully played out.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              8/When in Doubt, Sell it Out
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is an important rule for me. Sometimes, I become unsure of a company. Maybe its the management
                              or maybe its an event like data. Something just happens that makes me question the company. My rule is to sell
                              out of the company and wait 30 days. The 30 days is the wash sale rule in case I am taking a loss on that company.
                              I can at least lock in that loss for taxes. After 30 days, I can assess again and buy them back if I find it 
                              wasn't an issue. I find a lot of investors feel like they are not investors if they walk away from a company for 
                              while. There is no merit badge for loyaly in investing. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              9/Never Buy all At Once
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This rule reminds me I don't have a cyrstal ball. Most of investing is ruled by emotions which make us
                              do the opposite of what we should be doing. We get excited by the rallies and want to load up the truck.
                              We get scared into the sell offs and don't ever want to buy. I set a rule to buy a little each time the stock
                              pulls back a good 10% to 20% from my last purchase. In this age of investing, I can tade with no fees at all. 
                              There is no reason for me to buy a huge position all at once. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              10/Playing With the Houses Money
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This rule is about remembering to take profits so that I can pay off my investment with the profits. Nothing
                              is better in investing than owning something for free. The goal, for me, is to take profits into the bull markets
                              so I can pay off my core position. Then I can buy back more shares into the next bear market. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              11/The 10th Man Rule
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is a newer rule for me. I used it for many years, but I did not ever consider it a rule. The 10th man
                              is a concept I took from World War Z. I know it was an official rule before then, but that is when I adopted
                              it as an official rule. This states that if you have 10 people and they all agree on something, the job of 
                              the 10th man is to disagree with the other 9 and try to prove them wrong. I find this to be the most powerful 
                              rule. This is about remaining objective and not getting caught up in the emotions or excitement. I use social
                              media every day. When I make a statement that is bullish or bearish about the biotech sector or a biotech company,
                              I can get immediate
                              feeback. When everyone agrees with me, I have to assume I am wrong. When no one agrees with me, I have to assume
                              I might be right. 
                         </p>
