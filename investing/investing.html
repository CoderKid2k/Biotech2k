                              Financial Literacy
                         </h2>

                         <p>
                              I have been investing for 27 years now, but I would not consider myself an expert. I always consider 
                              myself a student of Savings and Investing. I am always learning and taking courses on the topics of 
                              Financial Planning and Investing. This is not designed to be financial advice as I am not a 
                              professional. This is designed to help you learn from my experiences. The one thing we do not teach 
                              in our educational system is Financial Literacy. This is one topic we are forced to go out and learn 
                              on our own. Statistics show that the average American only has about $150,000 saved for retirement. 
                              That leaves many Americans unprepared for retirement or any other major life event. When I got into 
                              learning about Financial Planning and investing, it dramatically changed my life. In recent years, I 
                              have learned more and more about financial planning through courses on these topics. Here I am going 
                              to share with you my understanding of the concepts so they might help you develop an interest in 
                              learning to Save and Invest. That way you can decide if it's something you want to pursue more 
                              before spending money on any courses. Hopefully, I have covered these concepts well enough that you 
                              won't even have to spend money on learning more.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="trading">Trading Around a Core Position</h2>
                         <p> 
                              My system for trading around my core position is a simple one. I will accumulate half of my position
                              for my core holding. Then I will trade around that core position by buying shares into sell offs. Then
                              I sell some of those shares during the big rallies. I tend to use 20% as my rule. If a stock pulls back 20%,
                              I will add a little for trading shares. I will keep adding some each 20% it pulls back until it bottoms, 
                              or I have reached my max position size. When the stock goes back up, I will sell a little each time it goes 
                              up 20% until I have reached my minimum core position. I will not sell my core position unless I think the 
                              company is fundamentally broken. Then I will sell everything. 
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              If the stock hits new highs, I will wait for at least a 20% pull back from that high before I even consider 
                              buying some trading shares. Stocks in biotech can have very wild swings. We all just witnessed this in 2021 and 
                              2022. We saw biotech stocks lose 70% or more of their value. That is a huge swing that could be hundreds of 
                              percent for the investor who buys low and fades the next bull market. Just in the 2020 crash from covid, many 
                              biotech stocks rallied between 300% and 800% from the bottom of 2020 to the top of 2021. When I think the market 
                              is extremely bubbly, I will even sell most if not everything and wait. I hit 100% cash in July of 2015 before 
                              the 2015 and 2016 bear market related to the pricing debate. I hit 90% cash in January of 2021. I think my biggest 
                              regret was starting to nibble back stocks too soon. I waited a good 20% to 30% off the top of the biotech top, 
                              but it turned out to be way too soon. 
                         </p>

                              My style tends to embrace what I find to be the best of both Investing and Trading. For me, it keeps me 
                              active and engaged with investing. It also allows me to make short term money while
                              making long term investments. I like to use trading around my core position to use capital gains to pay down
                              my cost basis. I will track my capital gains and subtract them from my cost basis. Once my cost gets to $0, I 
                              have paid for my core position. It is now on the house's money. I can hold it forever, and it doesn't cost 
                              me a thing.
