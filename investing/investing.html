                              Investing in biotech can be hard. The statistics show that 90% of the science that enters the clinic fails.
                              When investing in biotech, I find that I do better when I have a good strategy. I think strategy trumps any conviction
                              I might have in any company. I blend a hybrid strategy of trading and investing that works well for me.
                              I am not a financial advisor, but I have been investing for 27 years. Here in the Investing section,
                              I will share my biotech portfolio and all my strategies for investing. This section will focus on sharing
                              how I build my portfolio by focusing on these key innovation themes. I will share how I research companies
                              and rank them from best to worst for each science theme. I will share how I manage my portfolio strategy with
                              trading around my core position. I will share my system for valuing biotech companies. I will share my rules
                              for staying disciplined. This is not designed to be financial advice. You should always consult a professional 
                              financial advisor before making any investments.

                         <p> 
                              I started in 1996 and have been actively investing for 27 years. I have been retired since 2000 and 
                              doing investing as a hobby. I have a small biotech portfolio I started back in 2011 that I use for playing 
                              biotech stocks. I typically have between 10 and 20 companies in my portfolio. Right now, I think it 
                              is well over 30. That is because the market has been in such a huge bear market for biotech
                              that I have been buying everything I can. I don't like to put too much stock in any one company as biotech is
                              very speculative, and the statistics show that 90% of these early stage companies fail. I usually don't 
                              put more than 3% to 5% in any single company. At least not early on. 
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              I like to play baskets of companies based on key science concepts. I start with concepts like 
                              Techbio, CRISPR, Synthetic Biology and iPSC. Then I assess every company in that space until I find 
                              all the top companies I like. I will build a basket of those companies. I typically have 3 to 5 
                              science themes and each theme has a max cap of 20% of my portfolio. I will usually have 3 to 5 companies 
                              in each theme. Less than 2 companies and it is not a theme. More than 5 has to be narrowed down to the 
                              best of the best. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I never risk more than 3% to 5% of my money in any single company. That means I will only exceed that limit
                              if I have enough capital gains to reduce my cost basis. For example, if I had gains that equal 2% of total 
                              portfolio in a company, I would be willing to own up to 7% of my total in that company because only 5% of 
                              that would be my money. The rest is already paid for. Most of the time, I am cutting companies out that did 
                              not live up to expectations while building positions into new companies into market corrections.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I never buy all my stock in a company at one time. I tend to like to nibble away at it as it comes down in 
                              price. With today's free trading at most brokers, there is no reason to buy a ton of stock at one time unless 
                              you think you can predict the market. Once I have built my position in a company, I tend to trade around that 
                              position taking profits when the markets are up and buying some back when the markets are down. I tend to use 
                              20% as a rule for buying or selling on stock moves, but not always. I like to watch the market sentiment to see 
                              when things are over loved or over hated. I never sell my core shares in a company unless I think it has become 
                              fundamentally broken. I try to keep half of my position as my core position and use half for trading around 
                              my position into the market swings. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              I find this strategy works best for me as it gives me the best of long term investing and the best of short 
                              term trading. It keeps me active enough that I don't get bored and quit, but also focused on the long term so 
                              I don't miss the bigger picture. This is just my strategy.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="fundamentals">Fundamental Analysis</h2>
                         <p> 
                              I have always been a fundamental and value investor. I solely focus on picking companies. 
                              I don't care about charts, and I really don't care about the overall economy. The economy goes 
                              through its up cycles and it goes through its down cycles. The up cycles are good for taking profits and the down cycles 
                              are good for accumulating. I focus on the companies. I focus on the fundamentals and the value as they tell me the 
                              2 most important things about a company. The fundamentals tell me what I should buy. Fundamentals are about the
                              quality of the company. I also focus on the value of the company. Value tells me when I should buy a company.
                              Companies go from expensive to cheap as the economy goes through its cycles. I learn to sell some on the up cycle
                              and buy it back on the down cycle. When it comes to fundamentals, I tend to focus on two key aspects of companies that I feel
                              are the magic formula to success. They are Management and Science. 
                         </p>                   
                    </section>
               
                    <section>
                         <h2 class="investing-headers">Management</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Great management can turn even average science into a successful company. Bad management can wreck even 
                              the best science.  I would never own a company with what I perceive to be weak management. When I look 
                              at a company's  management, I really look at the CEO. They are the captain of the ship and ultimately 
                              all decisions go through them. I like to evaluate a company's management over time. It really takes time 
                              to figure out if management knows what they are talking about, and if they are living up to their promises.
                         </p>
                         <p>      
                              I like to go over at least a year's worth of conferences, webcasts and earnings calls.  I take notes on 
                              what was promised, like drug development timelines, and then I check off the promises delivered and circle 
                              those that are not. If they miss a deadline, and they provide a good reason for it, I will let it go. I know
                              Covid has delayed many company's deadlines. I don't expect perfection. I expect consistency. As long as 
                              there is not a habit of dropping the ball. I like to follow a company for a few months and listen to 
                              conferences in real time before I make any commitment to buy. Then I start slowly with a small position and 
                              only add when I think the company is impressing me with the results like data or events. It is like any other 
                              relationship. I have to take the time to get to know the company and trust the management before I commit 
                              my hard earned money to them.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A great CEO will be honest and have integrity. They are straight shooters. They are going to tell you what 
                              they expect and admit when the results don't match up to it.  A weak CEO will try to explain away bad data 
                              or try to spin bad data as if it were good data. Those are the ones you have to be aware of. A great CEO 
                              just lets the data speak for itself, and tells the truth. A great CEO is also a great communicator. They 
                              go to various conferences and love to talk about their company. They also have to be able to communicate 
                              well. You want to see the CEO be able to handle the tough questions with grace and ease. What I don't want to 
                              see is a CEO who is hyping or pumping up the science or company. They tend to be the worst with throwing around flashy 
                              buzz words just to crush investors when it all fails.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              A great CEO must be a good financial manager. Managing 
                              cash balance is key in the biotech market where a stock can go through long periods of "out of favor".  I 
                              like to see at least 2 years of cash on the balance sheet to get through the lean times. It is also 
                              important for a CEO to time the secondaries when they will be best received. I like to see them take 
                              advantage of investor optimism and sell into the big rallies based on good data or just market excitement. Another 
                              major aspect of good financial management is not recklessly spending money. I see some companies that have 
                              just so much going on that they burn huge amounts of cash. They become giant money pits. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              A great CEO needs 
                              to navigate the regulatory process very well.  I see it too often where an inexperienced CEO makes tons of 
                              blunders with trial design, regulatory submission, manufacturing inspections and communicating with the 
                              FDA. This leads to delays in timing of trials, clinical holds, Complete Response Letters (CRL's) or even bad 
                              trial outcomes. It can be hard to know if a CEO is one of these rookies, but it usually shows up quickly in 
                              the data. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The 
                              last and most important attribute of a CEO for me is visionary. A great CEO has to make great decisions 
                              around company development. They have a vision about their company and where they want it to go. They make 
                              great decisions to develop the long term story. They make good partnerships where needed. They make good 
                              decisions about which indications to pursue first. Some CEO's lack decision making and spend a huge amount 
                              of money trying to chase everything at once. A good leader will pick a few key programs and pursue them to 
                              commercial before spending more money. A good leader won't always be perfect so I don't sell on just one 
                              bad event like a trial failure or a delay with a trial. If it becomes a habit by happening more than once, 
                              then that is an alarm the CEO might not be up to the task. I personally think that management makes up about 
                              70% of the value of a company.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers">Science</h2>
                         <p> 
                              The quality of the science is the other part of the magic formula for a winning company. I look for a 
                              technology platform that can yield many new drugs. I also like companies focused on mastering one 
                              science. Some companies look like a swap meet of different sciences. They tend to be a Jack of all Trades, 
                              but a master of none. Here are some attributes that I look for in a company's science and pipeline.
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              When it comes to science, there is never a lack of great companies out there who are innovating. What I 
                              focus on is getting the best bang for my buck when it comes to picking science. It all comes down to picking 
                              the science that has the largest overall potential. If 2 companies have great science, which one has the 
                              biggest potential? One might have an innovative drug, but it only applies to a few hundred patients. The other
                              might be just as innovative but help millions of patients. When investing in companies, I want to pick those 
                              who have innovation, but also the largest potential. That means great companies have more than one drug 
                              in the pipeline. I don't want any one-hit wonders. They tend to be 
                              too volatile and way too binary. They are either huge wins or massive losses. They can be gut wrenching.
                              I want a technology platform that can yield many successful drugs. Those are the big winners when their 
                              technology works out. They can keep following up one success after another.
                         </p>      
                         <p>
                              I like to look for companies that have science that separates them from the rest of the pack. You want a 
                              competitive advantage in any business and game changing science is one such method. I want superior 
                              science compared to peers, or I want a company with no competition in a new area of science. I tend to 
                              focus on picking areas of science that are leading the technology in the industry. This means I am betting on 
                              my ability to pick out innovative new science. I have to assume I will be wrong on a lot of these companies as 
                              they are so speculative and early stage. I manage this using strategy. I pick a basket of companies in a new 
                              innovative space and place small bets on each. Then I monitor them as they advance the science. I use the data 
                              to weed out the weak companies and buy more of the winners. I reward success and don't reward failure. Eventually, 
                              I will jettison the losers when the markets are back in bull market mode, and I can sell them for the best prices.
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              When evaluating companies as the data comes in, I don't dump a company if they have a failure early on. 
                              Too many times, I have seen a company fail once just to make a massive comeback. Failure is part of the game 
                              for early stage biotech. What I don't want to see is a pattern of failure. If I have a company that has a big 
                              clinical setback, I put them on probation until they get another data readout. Good data forgives the older 
                              failure, but another failure confirms it. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The final aspect is I focus on key areas of science. Biotech is a big space. There is a lot of science across 
                              so many areas of disease. I find I do better when I pick a few key areas to focus on. Sure, I might miss a 
                              great company that develops a good new Alzheimer's drug. That is fine because my focus allows me to be an expert 
                              in the areas I focus on. I have more success when I focus. I used to cover anything in biotech, but I found that I 
                              was hindered by areas of science where I did not have the expertise to keep up. That is when I switched to focus 
                              on key science themes for me. I focus on Genetics, Immunology, Hematology and Oncology. They are all extremely
                              complementary to each other. Oncology actually requires a mastery of Genetics and Immunology.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="valueinvesting">Valuing Biotech</h2>
                         <p> 
                              My system for valuing biotech is something I developed over the years. I built this system 
                              to be an easy way to get a general ballpark valuation for a company so I can tell if it is 
                              overvalued or undervalued. I built it from years of watching how company's stocks respond to
                              clinical data. The value a company loses or gains on a clinical data read out informs us to what 
                              the value was attributed to that program in the value of the stock. Then I have to assume 2 
                              variables in this value. The first is the valuation takes into account the potential of the program. A 
                              program that could do $1 billion in sales would be worth more than one that could do $250 million 
                              in sales. The second assumption is the valuation takes in consideration the level of validation of the
                              program. A phase 3 program is more validated than one in phase 1. It would have a bigger impact on
                              valuation than a program in phase 1. If both these assumptions are true, then we can use the move 
                              in a company's stock price based on a clinical failure or success to inform us of the value.
                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              My model is a sum of the parts model. I take each drug in the pipeline and figure out what it could earn 
                              in revenues at peak sales. Then I adjust that value based on the level of validation of that drug. That gives 
                              me the value for that single drug. Then I add up all the value for all the programs and add in the cash. 
                              If I have a drug worth $500 million value, a second worth $250 million, and the company has $500 million cash, 
                              my valuation would be $500 million + $250 million + $500 million = $1.25 billion value.
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              The key values here are estimating peak sales and adjusting those sales based on the level of clinical 
                              validation. You can often get estimates for sales from analysts or even the company. The harder 
                              way is more accurate, but takes more time. If you follow your companies, they will often define for you the 
                              size of the patient population in their presentations. Then all you need to do is find prices of 
                              comparable drugs, and you can calculate peak sales. The only change would be to adjust for potential market share 
                              for competition. The level of validation for the drug would simply be the level of clinical success it has 
                              achieved. I take the peak sales and adjust them for the phase of development using .1x for preclinical, 1x for 
                              phase 1 data, 2x for phase 2 data, 3x for phase 3 data and 5x sales for a mature biotech valuation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once you have the value for each drug in the pipeline, you just add them up and add in the cash on the 
                              balance sheet. This will give you a total valuation for the company. You can compare the market cap you 
                              calculated to the current market cap to see if it is too expensive or too cheap. You can even adjust your 
                              valuation based on the outstanding shares and get a stock price for that valuation. Every time a company 
                              reports they will issue a 10Q or 10K. The very first page will list the number of outstanding shares at 
                              the time of reporting. You can divide your valuation by the shares outstanding and get a price target.
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="trading">Trading Around a Core Position</h2>
                         <p> 
                              My system for trading around my core position is a simple one. I will accumulate half of my position
                              for my core holding. Then I will trade around that core position by buying shares into sell offs. Then
                              I sell some of those shares during the big rallies. I tend to use 20% as my rule. If a stock pulls back 20%,
                              I will add a little for trading shares. I will keep adding some each 20% it pulls back until it bottoms, 
                              or I have reached my max position size. When the stock goes back up, I will sell a little each time it goes 
                              up 20% until I have reached my minimum core position. I will not sell my core position unless I think the 
                              company is fundamentally broken. Then I will sell everything. 
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              If the stock hits new highs, I will wait for at least a 20% pull back from that high before I even consider 
                              buying some trading shares. Stocks in biotech can have very wild swings. We all just witnessed this in 2021 and 
                              2022. We saw biotech stocks lose 70% or more of their value. That is a huge swing that could be hundreds of 
                              percent for the investor who buys low and fades the next bull market. Just in the 2020 crash from covid, many 
                              biotech stocks rallied between 300% and 800% from the bottom of 2020 to the top of 2021. When I think the market 
                              is extremely bubbly, I will even sell most if not everything and wait. I hit 100% cash in July of 2015 before 
                              the 2015 and 2016 bear market related to the pricing debate. I hit 90% cash in January of 2021. I think my biggest 
                              regret was starting to nibble back stocks too soon. I waited a good 20% to 30% off the top of the biotech top, 
                              but it turned out to be way too soon. 
                         </p>   
                         <p>
                              My style tends to embrace what I find to be the best of both Investing and Trading. For me, it keeps me 
                              active and engaged with investing. It also allows me to make short term money while
                              making long term investments. I like to use trading around my core position to use capital gains to pay down
                              my cost basis. I will track my capital gains and subtract them from my cost basis. Once my cost gets to $0, I 
                              have paid for my core position. It is now on the house's money. I can hold it forever, and it doesn't cost 
                              me a thing.

                         <h2 class="investing-headers" id="discipline">Rules to Stay Disciplined</h2>
                         <p> 
                              When it comes to staying disciplined to my strategy, I love to make up rules. I love to give them
                              catch names that make them easy to remember.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              1/Don't Put All Your Eggs in One Basket
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is probably a rule everyone has heard about in investing. It is the rule about being diversified and 
                              not putting all my money into one company or one investment. This rule is about managing my risk in case 
                              one company becomes the next Theranos. I know some people 
                              will put more money in companies they have the highest conviction in and less money in those companies they 
                              find more risky. I tend to do things differently. I like to risk a little to make a lot. I don't have to swing for 
                              the fences with every pitch. I tend to have at least 10 companies and like to have about 20 so I am not putting
                              more than 5% in a single company.

                         </p>    
                         <p>
                              One of the biggest risks I see in the market is the Get Rich Quick mentality. I have never seen anyone
                              get rich quick, but I have seen a lot of people get wiped out in a flash. When it comes to investing, I do 
                              not gamble. I do not go all in on one highly speculative company no matter how much I believe in it. I 
                              don't play binary events like clinical readouts. I don't use margin and I don't play options. I tend to use 
                              a very simple strategy of value investing. If I want to gamble, I will go to Vegas where it is far more 
                              fun and entertaining. I know a lot of people think investing is gambling, but it is not. You have information 
                              and data in investing that allows you to make educated decisions about companies. Not getting swept up in the 
                              Fear of Missing out or euphoria of the market is a discipline of its own.

                         </p>  
                         <p>
                              I mentioned this before in the right sizing of investment positions. 
                              I can't tell you how many people I come across that are all in 1 company or 1 investment. It blows my mind 
                              that they are so confident to lose all their money if one event happens that disrupts that investment. Diversification
                              goes hand in hand with Position Sizing. People who are retired should not be 80% in speculative biotech or some 
                              new fad crypto coin.
                              I see way too many investors who focus only on the reward and completely dismiss the risk. I go by the idea of managing 
                              the risk as the rewards will take care of themselves. I never risk more than 5% of my own money on any single company.

                              4/The Starship Trooper Rule
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is one of my favorite rules. It comes from the movie where the captain says, "The job is yours 
                              until you die or I find better". This rule is important to remember when investing. It is about keeping good 
                              companies for as long as they remain good companies. I see too many investors turn an investment into a 
                              trade. They buy a company and it pops 50%. They sell it all. Then they miss out on the next 300% it goes 
                              up because they had the investment right, but they sold it for a trade. I never sell out of a company unless 
                              it fails or I find better. This rule keeps me in the winners for the long term.

                              5/The 3 Stooges Rule
                         </p> 
                         <p>
                              This rule is about the value of management. Watching some company's management is like watching an episode 
                              of the 3 Stooges. It would actually be funny if it were not losing investors money. I will never own a company where
                              I have any doubts about the management. I will often sell a company should the management change. That depends 
                              on my position and my belief in the previous management.

                              6/I Would Rather Pay up for Success than be Overweight Failure
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is my key rule for biotech investing. Many investors will expect everything to go right for their 
                              highly speculative company. They will buy a big position into data expecting a good read out. Any failure 
                              costs them a ton of money. I tend to reward success. I like to keep my positions small and buy more of companies 
                              that have good data while avoiding the ones that have bad data. That develops my portfolio naturally to be 
                              weighted to the winners. These companies have a long road to commercial success. Waiting for the data might 
                              miss a quick pop, but it will be far from over.

                              7/The Kenny Roger Rule
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              You got to know when to hold them and know when to fold them. This rule is about being truthful with myself
                              and admitting I got a company wrong. This rule allows me to get rid of the bad companies before they turn little
                              losses into big losses. Sometimes, getting out of a company isn't about them going bad. Sometimes the company 
                              has just fully matured. This is when the company's future does not seem like it could drive a much higher 
                              valuation. I can think of a few companies that reached a point where I could not see a future that was brighter 
                              than their past. They were fully played out.
                         </p>

                              8/When in Doubt, Sell it Out
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is an important rule for me. Sometimes, I become unsure of a company. Maybe it is the management
                              or maybe it is an event like data. Something just happens that makes me question the company. My rule is to sell
                              out of the company and wait 30 days. The 30 days is the wash sale rule in case I am taking a loss on that company.
                              I can at least lock in that loss for taxes. After 30 days, I can assess again and buy them back if I find it 
                              wasn't an issue. I find a lot of investors feel like they are not investors if they walk away from a company for 
                              a while. There is no merit badge for loyalty in investing.

                              9/Never Buy all At Once
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This rule reminds me I don't have a crystal ball. Most of investing is ruled by emotions which make us
                              do the opposite of what we should be doing. We get excited by the rallies and want to load up the truck.
                              We get scared into the sell offs and don't ever want to buy. I set a rule to buy a little each time the stock
                              pulls back a good 10% to 20% from my last purchase. In this age of investing, I can trade with no fees at all. 
                              There is no reason for me to buy a huge position all at once.

                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This rule is about remembering to take profits so that I can pay off my investment with the profits. Nothing
                              is better in investing than owning something for free. The goal, for me, is to take profits into the bull markets
                              so I can pay off my core position. Then I can buy back more shares into the next bear market.

                              11/The 10th Man Rule
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This is a newer rule for me. I used it for many years, but I did not ever consider it a rule. The 10th man
                              is a concept I took from World War Z. I know it was an official rule before then, but that is when I adopted
                              it as an official rule. This states that if you have 10 people and they all agree on something, the job of 
                              the 10th man is to disagree with the other 9 and try to prove them wrong. I find this to be the most powerful 
                              rule. This is about remaining objective and not getting caught up in the emotions or excitement. I use social
                              media every day. When I make a statement that is bullish or bearish about the biotech sector or a biotech company,
                              I can get immediate
                              feedback. When everyone agrees with me, I have to assume I am wrong. When no one agrees with me, I have to assume
                              I might be right.
