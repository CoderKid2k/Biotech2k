                                   AbCellera is using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to focus on developing 
                                   antibodies. This is a huge space of development with over 174 programs under contract and 101 program starts.
                                   They only work through partners and have no pipeline of their own. They use Artificial Intelligence 
                                   to help sequence and design antibodies. They can even model the simulation of each antibody's response.
                                   They can use Machine Learning to help pick antibodies that perform exactly to specifications. They are developing 
                                   programs for T cell engager, Ion Channels and GPCR receptors. They continue to expand their capabilities toward 
                                   being able to develop programs up to the IND.

                                   I have only been following AbCellera for a short time, but so far I think CEO Carl Hansen is doing a great job 
                                   with the company. He has demonstrated the ability of the company to work with partners to develop two antibodies 
                                   for Covid that did really good royalites during the pandemic. They continue to add new partners and programs while 
                                   improving their royalty sharing on new programs. They continue to expand their capabilities toward taking programs 
                                   up to the IND point of development.

                                   AbCellera is using AI and Machine learning to develop antibodies for partners. They have 174 
                                   programs under contract with 8 of them now in the clinic with their programs. They are developing 
                                   programs around T cell engagers, Ion Channels and GPCR receptors. Oncology makes up over 50% of their 
                                   indications of target across their partnership programs.

                                   Revenues next year are estimated to decline by over 70% to $110 million. That is worth about
                                   $500 million based on a standard 5 multiplier for biotech companies.

                                   I think they could yield over $2 billion royalties should all their programs work out. They 
                                   get royalties on these programs. All their current programs are in the early stage of development so 
                                   I would value that at .5x multiplier. That would make the pipeline worth about $1 billion in value.
