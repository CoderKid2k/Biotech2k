                                   Caribou is a gene editing and cell therapy company. They use the CAS12 enzyme with their proprietary 
                                   chRDNA guide technology. They chose to deploy their technology in developing cell therapies. They are working 
                                   on T cells ex-vivo and induced Pluripotent Stem Cells for NK cell therapies. I think they are using the CAR-T 
                                   therapies to test out key edits like PD-1 knockout, MHC I knockout and HLA-E insertion. These key edits can 
                                   drive advancements in cell therapies. Eventually, they will combine all the successful edits into all their therapies.
                                   That will probably require them to move more into iPSC cells as the efficiency would drop significantly by doing that 
                                   many edits to each cell. Their data showed just 2 targeted insertions dropped the efficiency to about 63% of cells
                                   getting all the edits. That is very low if they want to do cell engineering down the road.

                                   I have been following Rachel Haurwitz since Caribou has gone public. I think she has done a good job with managing the 
                                   company so far. They have some good data in allogeneic CAR-T which shows they are doing good on the 
                                   science front. I am not sure I am on board with all her decisions though. There is so much more they could 
                                   be doing with gene editing. They could have an entire pipeline of gene editing programs. Yet they focus on 
                                   cell therapies which are only a tiny fraction of the size of what gene editing could make.

                                   CB-010 is their CD19 CAR-T therapy where they use allogeneic T cells from donors. They edit these cells 
                                   to knock out the PD-1 receptor. This protects these cells from the tumor microenvironment by preventing T cell 
                                   exhaustion. The early data was very impressive for an allogeneic program with 100% complete response rates. The 
                                   only issue was the durability still fell off at 6 months like other allogeneic programs. The effects of PD-1 knockout 
                                   improved efficacy, but not durability which is the key issue in allogeneic programs. We should see an update on 
                                   this program later this year.
                              </p>

                                   CB-011 is their BCMA CAR-T therapy where they knockout the MHC I and replace it with HLA-E. This is designed to 
                                   prevent cells from being rejected by the host immune system. We know that HLA-E helps prevent NK cell rejection, but not 
                                   completely. We will have to see how much benefit this edit really gives to durability. They are calling their 
                                   version of immune evasion Camouflage. They are enrolling the first dose now in the phase 1 trial. We might see some 
                                   data later in the year.

                                   knock out PD-1. This is the program I expected as it includes both the edits of the first 2 programs. It will 
                                   probably set the stage for all their future cell therapies with these key edits. These edits are designed to 
                                   prevent cells from being rejected by the host immune system and avoid T cell exhaustion. We know that
                                   HLA-E helps prevent NK cell rejection. We will have to see how much benefit these edits have combined. This will

                                   CB-020 is their preclinical induced Pluripotent Stem Cell platform for NK cells. It 
                                   is targeting ROR1 which is part of the Wnt signaling pathway. We haven't seen much from this 
                                   platform so far. I think they are using the T cells to test the edits so they know which ones 
                                   work best before 
                                   using them in the iPSC programs.
