                                   Ginkgo is a Commercial Research Organization that is the leader in Synthetic Biology.
                                   They are driving down cost by driving up a level of scale that is commercially beneficial to customers. 
                                   They are focused on 2 key franchises with synthetic
                                   biology and biosecurity. The foundry and codebase make up their synthetic biology platform. Synthetic Biology 
                                   brings together cell engineering, chemistry and genetic editing to alter the DNA of cells to create new organisms 
                                   with new purpose. Their subsidiary Concentric is focused on biosecurity solutions. This is about developing 
                                   technologies to detect, test, track and predict pathogens and outbreaks. We live in a world where bioterrorism 
                                   is one of the biggest risks we face.

                                   I have been following Ginkgo and Jason Kelly since they went public. I know a lot of people find him 
                                   to be smug and arrogant. I used to defend him as passionate, but I have recently backed off after 
                                   watching the top 3 management members in this company sell tens of millions of shares in the last few 
                                   months. I suspect most of it is for tax purposes. I have now become a skeptic until proven otherwise 
                                   with this management team.

                                   The foundry is all about engineering living organisms. Cells are encoded with DNA which acts as the programming for that cell. 
                                   It doesn't matter if it is a human T cell, a bacteria or a yeast cell. If you learn how to change the 
                                   DNA of living cells, you can recode their programming to make them do whatever you want. The codebase is that 
                                   database that Ginkgo has for all that genetic programming information. With synthetic biology, we can rewrite life
                                   and create new organisms with new purposes. This can be a yeast that makes a mediation or ingredient for manufacturing.
                                   It could even be something that changes the world like bacteria that creates fertilizer in the fields or an algae
                                   cell that cleans carbon emissions from the environment. We can create safe bacteria in the food and water that emit 
                                   a glow when they come in contact with harmful pathogens or toxins.

                                   Biosecurity is about protecting this new world of biology from pathogens that can harm us. This is about tracking 
                                   and preventing pandemics. We live in a world where we have the tools for bad people to create a pathogen that could
                                   wipe out the entire world. We need to have the tools to be able to detect, track, contain and prevent these types 
                                   of events. Pathogens do not respect borders which makes them a global threat. The biosecurity franchise is all
                                   about building the tools to test and the 
                                   software to track and model outbreaks.

                                   Foundry only earns about $160 million in sales right now. That is because this platform is like a pipeline 
                                   for other biotech companies. Programs are put into the foundry when a company partners with Ginkgo. It can take
                                   years for these programs to be completed to the level of commercial launch. They get paid a small amount for their 
                                   work, but most of the value is in the form of Equity Stakes, Royalties and Milestones. The key here is to watch 
                                   the number of programs they have in their pipeline. That is the indicator of potential future revenues. I think they 
                                   could reach $1 billion in foundry revenues in the next 7 to 10 years. I would give this a value of $1.6 billion 
                                   based on realistic price to sales on their current foundry sales.

                                   Biosecurity has been really strong since Covid. There is some concern it could fall off as Covid sales 
                                   fade. This hasn't happened yet as Covid has shown us how poorly prepared we were as a country and as a world to deal 
                                   with pandemics. Right now, they are doing $300 million in biosecurity sales. That gives it a value of about $3 billion 
                                   in value based on a realistic price to sales.
