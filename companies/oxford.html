                                   Oxford uses what is called Nanopore technology. This uses a film with tiny pores in it. 
                                   They pass a current across the film. Then the sequence is run through the pore. As each 
                                   different nucleotide passes through the pore, it will make a different sound. This allows the 
                                   software to record those sounds and build a consensus of the sequence being processed. This 
                                   is long read sequencing technology. My biggest concern for this company is the stock trades on
                                   the European exchanges. It is only listed in the US on the over the counter markets. They allow 
                                   for US investors to own the company, but the OTC market is extremely illiquid.

                                   I just started following Oxford Nanopore and its CEO Gordon Sanghera. I havenâ€™t even had a chance 
                                   to hear them present at any conferences yet. It will take some time to follow them and get a feel 
                                   for the management team.

                                   When it comes to sequencing, nanopore technology tends to have the strength of versatility. They have 
                                   a selection of machines which allow for different applications based on the user's needs. This is 
                                   definitely one of their strengths. They have significantly closed the gap on accuracy by improving this 
                                   technology and the consensus read software.

                                   They currently have about $200 million in annual sales projected for 2022. The market for sequencing is estimated to double 
                                   from 2022 to 2026 from $7 billion to $14 billion. With multiple products on the market, I think Oxford 
                                   could capture at least $1 billion in sales over the long term. At just 10x sales, that would be worth a $5 billion 
                                   market cap. Their current value would be around $2 billion based on current sales.

                                   All in, that is a $2.35 billion market cap. Based on the 823 million shares outstanding, that comes to $3.15.
