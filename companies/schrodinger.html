                                   physics based chemistry to design molecules. They are focused on translating physics based 
                                   chemistry into computer aided design. They have added a lot of other software around
                                   the drug discovery process to include Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. They use the 
                                   software that develops the chemistry models to train the machine learning algorithms.
                                   They license this software to other companies. They recently started
                                   using their own software to develop their own pipeline.

                                   I have been following Schrodinger for about a year now. I think Ramy Farid is a very solid CEO. He is 
                                   focused on the tech and software side of the company. He seems like a good business person with 
                                   running software sales. They hired Karen Akinsanya to run the biotech side of the business for drug 
                                   discovery. I think does a great job on science and drug discovery. I just wish they focused more on 
                                   the biotech side as it's where the biggest potential exists.

                                   Those companies did not have this level of software assisted engineering. We will have to wait and see 
                                   the data, but there is always room for this to succeed where others have failed. This plays a role in the

                                   Sales are projected to be $194 million in revenues for 2023 with their software side of the business. 
                                   The classic Price to Sales goes from 10x to 14x. Even at 10x that gets you $194 million * 10 for
                                   = $1.9 billion value.

                                   MALT1 could be upward of $750 million for B cell related cancers. It won't work in all B cell cancers. 
                                   It will be a subset that is driven by MALT1 signaling. Even so, there are limited targeted therapies
                                   for those patients. If I give it a .1 multiplier since it has no data, I would get $75 million value.

                                   CDC7 could do well over $1 billion in sales if it works well with CDK4/6 inhibitors which earn about $5 billion

                                   potential. This is still in development so I would only give it a .1 multiplier. That puts it at about $100
