                                   The drug discovery process takes about $1 billion dollars to develop a new drug. This can take years and 
                                   still 90% of the drugs that enter the clinic fail. This company is combining physics based computer modeling 
                                   with Machine Learning. They use the physics modeling software to create the data to teach the machine learning 
                                   algorithms. This allows them to design and predict molecules for drug discovery. They expanding this by adding other 
                                   software to help improve the drug development process. This can help improve the success rates of drugs that enter 
                                   the clinic while reducing the amount of cost it takes to validate drug targets before entering the clinic. 
                                   They currently license this software to other companies 
                                   across several industries to develop chemical compounds. Now they are using it to develop their own pipeline 
                                   of wholly owned drugs.

                                   I have been following Schrodinger for about a year now. I think Ramy Farid is a solid CEO. He is 
                                   focused on the tech and software side of the company. He seems like a good business person with 
                                   running software sales. They hired Karen Akinsanya to run the biotech side of the business for drug 
                                   discovery. I think she does a great job on science and drug discovery. I just wish they focused more on 
                                   the biotech side as it's where the biggest potential exists.

                                   SGR-1505 is their first drug for MALT1. This is a Caspase Activation and Recruitment 
                                   Domain (CARD). This plays a role in B cell activation and cytokine production. This plays a role in some B cell related 
                                   cancers which are driven by this signaling pathway. There is no data yet from this program, but it is opening sites now for 
                                   the dose escalation study.

                                   SGR-2291 is their second drug for CDC7. This plays a role in the cell cycle and the initiation 
                                   of DNA replication. It could partner with current CDK4/6 inhibitors which do about $5 billion a year

                                   SGR-3515 is their Wee1 drug. This target is one that has been attempted before by other companies, and it hasn't done so well.
                                   Those companies did not have this level of software assisted engineering. We will have to wait and see 
                                   the data, but there is always room for this to succeed where others have failed. This plays a role in the cell 
                                   cycle. This comes in during the last cell checkpoint before moving into mitosis. They have finally selected 
                                   a lead drug and will move it into IND enabling studies.

                                   The classic Price to Sales for this space is around 10x. That gets you $2.5 billion valuations on

                                   SGR-1505 could be upward of $750 million for B cell related cancers. It won't work in all B cell cancers. 
                                   It will be a subset that is driven by MALT1 signaling. Even so, there are limited targeted therapies

                                   a year. Even if it is only used in a small percentage of those patients, it could reach that $1 billion sales
                                   potential. This is still in development so I would only give it a .1 multiplier. That puts it at about $100
