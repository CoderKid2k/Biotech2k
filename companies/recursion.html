                                   Recursion is using robots to do experiments and collect data. 
                                   They are using technology to map biology. They have a lab
                                   where they can conduct millions of experiments every week. All that data is
                                   collected into their Biohive supercomputer. This can be mined by using Artificial
                                   Intelligence and Machine Learning. They can collect all the genotype 
                                   and phenotype data by using CRISPR to knock out each gene one at a time and 
                                   recording all the changes. This could lead us to discovering new connections
                                   between genetics and biology.

                                   I haven’t been following Recursion all that long, but I think Chris Gibson is doing a good job 
                                   so far. He is out there presenting a lot and talking about their technology. They are moving into 
                                   phase 2 with their programs, but they haven’t run any trials of their own before this. It will take 
                                   some time to see how well they manage the clinical development process.

                                   worth $750 million sales. I would put a 1x multiplier on this program. That makes this program
