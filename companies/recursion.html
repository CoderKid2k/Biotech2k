                                   Recursion is using robots to do experiments and collect data. 
                                   They are using technology to map biology. They have a lab
                                   where they can conduct millions of experiments every week. All that data is
                                   collected into their Biohive supercomputer. This can be mined by using Artificial
                                   Intelligence and Machine Learning. They can collect all the genotype 
                                   and phenotype data by using CRISPR to knock out each gene one at a time and 
                                   recording all the changes. This could lead us to discovering new connections
                                   between genetics and biology.
