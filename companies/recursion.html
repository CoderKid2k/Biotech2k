                                   Recursion is using robots to do experiments and collect data. They perform CRISPR gene 
                                   knockout experiments and record all the phenotypic changes to the cells. They have a lab
                                   where they can conduct millions of experiments every week. All that data is
                                   collected into their Biohive supercomputer. This can be mined by using Artificial
                                   Intelligence and Machine Learning. They can collect all the genotype 
                                   and phenotype data and use it to map biology. This could lead us to discovering new 
                                   connections between genetics and biology.

                                   I haven't been following Recursion all that long, but I think Chris Gibson is doing a good job 
                                   so far. He is out there presenting the science and talking about their technology. They are moving into 
                                   phase 2 with some of their programs, but they haven't run any trials of their own before this. Most of 
                                   their programs were already phase 1 when they in-licensed them.  It will take 
                                   some time to see how well they manage the clinical development process. They do seem to be doing a good 
                                   job of managing the balance sheet. They even have a ton of partners with upward of $13 billion in potential 
                                   milestones.

                                   tract related to FAP. This has some early safety data from phase 1. They are enrolling in a phase 2 trial for FAP and have 
                                   fast track for that indication. They are expanding the indications by adding AXIN1 and APC. They plan to 
                                   start those trials in 2024. There is a lot of rationale for using MEK1/2 inhibitors in these genetically

                                   REC-2282 - This is a HDAC inhibitor focused on targeting NF2 meningiomas. The early phase 1 data showed some
                                   safety which lacked the typical cardiac toxicity that is often related to these HDAC inhibitors. The increased safety 
                                   along with the CNS penetration of this molecule made it ideal for targeting Meningiomas from NF2. They plan to 
                                   present more safety data with an interim safety data readout in 2024. This is one of the 
                                   programs they in-licensed. We will need to see the efficacy data that supports this indication.

                                   worth $750 million sales. I would put a 1x multiplier on this program. That makes this program 
                                   worth $750 million value. Expansion into AXIN1 and APC would add another 60,000 patients which would double

                                   would do more than $750 million by my best guess. It does have phase 1 data for a 1x multiplier. That would
