                                   Relay is working on a suite of tools using physics based chemistry, computational
                                   modeling, AI and ML to discover drugs where many others have failed before. They use
                                   technologies to model proteins and enzymes in motion. Most people think of proteins as
                                   static structures that just fold based on electrostatic and hydrophobic forces.
                                   Proteins are actually very dynamic structures that perform functions and change their
                                   shape as they function. Relay is developing technologies to model proteins in motion so they
                                   can use other AI technologies to develop drugs against impossible targets. They will use
                                   AI to help screen targets and model the dynamics of these molecules for safety and efficacy.
                                   They use Machine Learning to screen thousands of possible drug candidates to pick the perfect
                                   ones that are worth moving into the clinic. They are using these technologies to take on
                                   some of the most toxic targets in Oncology.

                                   I have been following Relay and Sanjiv Patel for over a year now. I think he is a very strong 
                                   CEO. They have built a powerful technology platform from a combination of licensing and buying 
                                   technology. He is out there telling the story at the conferences and does a good job at doing it. 
                                   They even put up some early data that impressed investors to show they can handle the drug development 
                                   process. It will still take time to see if they can manage all aspects of building a powerhouse 
                                   biotech company.

                                   RLY-4008 - Their first drug is for FGFR2 which is a target that previously had high levels of 
                                   toxicity related to this drug class. Relay developed a FGFR2 inhibitor with significantly better efficacy and significantly
                                   lower toxicity than all drugs before it. They wowed investors with an 88% overall response rate in
                                   phase 1 data. The safety data was very impressive compared to previous drugs in this class. They are ongoing 
                                   with phase 1.

                                   RLY-2608 - This drug is for PI3Ka which has been a target
                                   of oncology in the past, but failed repeatedly due to toxicity related to glucose regulation.
                                   They made a major breakthrough here by targeting specific mutations in this protein that are not in
                                   the wild type. This allows them to specifically target just the mutants of the protein and leave the wild
                                   type untouched. Early safety data looked very clean. Now we need to see the efficacy data.

                                   pharmacokinetics from RLY-2608. This is designed to be a second shot on goal for the massive market in PI3Ka.
