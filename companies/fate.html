                                   Fate is the original company to develop induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. They have been leading 
                                   the space for many years. The biggest issue with being first is that science often moves faster 
                                   than the clinical trials. It did not take long to realize these early therapies were already outdated. 
                                   They did not have key edits to avoid immune rejection of the cells. I think Fate did the right 
                                   thing with scrapping all these older programs to move new programs into the clinic which have these 
                                   key edits. I hope they go down the road of using common progenitor cells as a starting stock. They 
                                   kept 2 key programs for NK cells and T cells. These look to be indications where they think they can 
                                   still drive potential for patients.

                                   I have been following Fate and Scott Wolchko for a few years now. He seems like a good CEO, but 
                                   they have had many setbacks in their development programs. First they dropped ProTmune and NK-100. 
                                   Now they had to reset and drop all their phase 1 NK programs to start over. I used to think he was a 
                                   powerful CEO, but now I have my doubts. I have been waiting for years for this investment to bear fruit.

                                   FT-576 is a CAR-NK cell therapy using a BCMA target. It has the enhanced CD16 receptor for improved use 
                                   with antibody therapies. It has the CD38 knockout so it can be combined with anti-CD38 antibodies for 
                                   Multiple Myeloma. This program is just entering phase 1, but data could help inform us on how well this combination 
                                   could work in Multiple Myeloma.

                                   FT-819 is their first iPSC derived CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19. This does not have the immune evasion edits 
                                   so I am not sure why they chose to keep this program. Maybe, they just wanted to validate the CAR-T platform 
                                   using this asset before they move into newer cells. They will need to add the immune evasion edits to all new 
                                   CAR-T cell therapies.

                                   FT-576 is for Multiple Myeloma which affects over 30,000 patients in the US alone. This will compete with other
                                   BCMA cell therapies. It would have to distinguish itself from the many other programs in this indication. I think 
                                   with the edits and combinations it has, it really could. I would give this $1 billion potential if it works out well.
                                   It gets a .1 multiplier for having no data yet. That is $100 million in value.

                                   FT-819 is their CD19 CAR-T for Lymphoma. This does not have the immune evasion edits. I don't think this program 
                                   will go beyond phase 1 to validate the concept of making iPSC derived T cells. I think they will eventually replace 
                                   this with CAR-T therapies with more edits.
