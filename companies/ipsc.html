                                   Century is building a platform around induced Pluripotent Stem cells. They take donor 
                                   cells and program them back into the stem cell state by adding in transcription factors.
                                   Then they edit those stem cells before developing them down the lineage to immune cells like 
                                   NK cells and Gamma/Delta T cells. This technology is engineering cells for immune therapies for cancer. 
                                   They build these common progenitor cells that have many edits to give them extra benefits and allo 
                                   evasion attributes. These common progenitor cells can become a starting stock for all their CAR-NK and 
                                   CAR-T cells. Once they have the master banks of common progenitor cells, they can use them 
                                   for all their new therapies by just inserting different CAR receptors into them before developing 
                                   them down their path to NK or T cells.

                                   I have only followed Century since their IPO. I have been cautious with Lalo Flores as he doesnâ€™t come 
                                   across as a very strong presenter at conferences. He has impressed me with the science and the way they 
                                   are developing the technology. It will take time to know as they are just starting clinical trials.

                                   CNTY-101 is their CAR-NK cell that has the alloevasion edits and a CD19 CAR. This is their original program for 
                                   CAR-NK cells currently starting phase 1. The alloevasion will allow us to compare this technology to other allogeneic 
                                   cell therapies targeting CD19. This data will inform us of the benefits, if any, of the alloevasion

                                   CNTY-102 is their first CAR-T program using the Gamma/Delta progenitor cells. This will have a dual target
                                   with CD19 and CD79. This will have many of the common progenitor cell edits for their Gamma/Delta T cell 
                                   platform. This will inform us as to the potential of using Gamma/Delta T cells as cell therapies. They will 
                                   also include the alloevasion edits. This is currently in IND enabling studies.

                                   CNTY-107 is their first program that will target a solid tumor antigen with Nectin 4. This has a large potential
                                   application in solid tumors. They have not selected yet if this program will be NK or Gamma/Delta T cells. I suspect 
                                   they will test both sources before they settle on a final development candidate.

                                   CNTY-101 is for CD19 which affects B cell lymphomas. This is about 75,000 patients each year. 
                                   It is a very competitive target for blood cancers. There is still room for a best in class therapy 
                                   should the alloevasion make a difference in durability. I would give this $500 million sales unless it 
                                   has some best in class data. No phase 1 data gives it a .1 multiple. That puts the value at $50 million.

                                   think this could have the same potential as CNTY-101 unless the data stands out as the best in class therapy.
                                   That would be $500 million in sales. It would only have a .1 multiplier for being preclinical. That comes 
                                   out to $50 million value.

                                   CNTY-107 is for solid tumors. I think this could be worth $1 billion or more depending on how well the data 
                                   works out. I would give it a multiple of .1 for preclinical. That comes out to $100 million value.

                                   All in, that is a $595 million market cap. Based on the 59 million shares outstanding, that comes to $10.08.
