                                   Verve is one of the two companies working with Base Editing. They licensed the technology from Beam 
                                   Therapeutics. They have the right to pick 4 gene targets for cardiovascular diseases. They have picked 
                                   PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 so far, and have 2 more they can pick. They have a license for CRISPR CAS12 which
                                   they license from Broad Institute and Harvard. Verve has a development platform for guided 
                                   LNP delivery. They have a delivery technology for their liver targets which is designed to target GalNac.
                                   Beam licenses this guided LNP from them for some of its liver programs.

                                   I haven't been following Verve or Sekar Kathiresan all that long. I do think he is a good CEO, but I 
                                   think he overestimates the potential for these therapies to take market share for existing therapies. 
                                   They are just starting in the clinic so we will have to wait to see some data. I do think they are 
                                   doing a good job of managing the balance sheet well. They seem to focus on innovation with a new novel 
                                   editor in the works.

                                   VERV-101 is a gene editing therapy that knocks out the PCSK9 gene. This is a gene associated with cardiovascular 
                                   disease. They have some promising early data for the knock down of LDL. The early data in the preclinic showed 
                                   about 67% LDL-C reduction. We will have to wait and see how that translates into humans with the phase 1 data.

                                   VERV-201 is a gene editing therapy that knocks out the ANGPTL3 gene. This gene plays a role in triglyceride 
                                   metabolism. The animal data here showed about a 96% reduction in the ANGPTL3. They are working on the IND enabling 
                                   studies and hope to have the IND in 2024.

                                   VERV-101 I think this will be a very competitive space competing with other PCSK9 antibodies and RNAi therapies.
                                   I think they will get only a small market share of the patient is HeFH. I would estimate about 20,000 patients 
                                   a year at a price of $40,000. That comes out to about $800 million in sales. I would give them a .1 multiplier
                                   for being in early phase 1. That comes to $80 million value.

                                   VERV-201 I think this program will compete with other very competitive cholesterol therapies.
                                   It is being tested in 2 different cholesterol diseases with one of them being HoFH.
                                   I think it could manage about 20,000 patients a year at a price of $40,000. 
                                   That would make this program about $800 million in sales. I would give them .1 multiplier for the preclinical stage
                                   of development. That comes out to another $80 million value.
