                                   Revolution Medicines is focused on the 2 key pathways inside cells that mutate and drive 
                                   cancer growth. These are the MAPK and mTOR pathways. They are very complex pathways so not 
                                   everything tested will work. There will be some hit and miss in these pathways to find right combinations

                                   RMC-6291 targets multiple forms of RAS to include mutiple KRAS targets. This is designed to be a pan inhibitor. 
                                   There is a lot of risk in this approach as any hitting of wild type RAS can come with serious side effects. The data shows 
                                   that upward of 30% of all cancers have a RAS mutation. This could affect well over 100,000 patients across multiple mutations.
                                   This is in early phase 1 with no data yet.

                                   RMC-6291 targets KRAS G12C. This is designed for 2 purposes. The first is it acts as a backup molecule should the multi 
                                   RAS drug fail. The second is it can be combined with the multi RAS drug in combinations for KRAS G12C cancers. This targets the 
                                   RAS on form of KRAS. This is different from other KRAS G12C drugs. It does this by binding the KRAS to cyclophilin A. This

                                   the top of the MAPK pathway. This is designed to be a companion inhibitor to RAS drugs. This is currently in phase 
                                   2 trials. The phase 1 data was encouraging, but it needs a dosing regiment to keep tolerability.

                                   RMC-6236 is the RAS multi drug with huge potential if the data works out. It could have a market size of 
                                   100,000 patients. Even if they get only 30% of that market at a $100,000 price, it comes out to $3 billion 
                                   in potential. I would give it a .1 multiplier which give this program $300 million value.

                                   size. I would only give this $250 million in potential unless the data proves otherwise. It has some phase 1 data which 
                                   gives it a multiplier of .5x. That makes it worth $125 million value.
