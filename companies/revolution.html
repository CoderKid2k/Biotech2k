                                   Revolution Medicines is focused on the 2 key pathways inside cells that mutate and drive 
                                   cancer growth. These are the MAPK and mTOR pathways. They are very complex pathways so not 
                                   everything tested will work. There will be some hit and miss in these pathways to find right combinations 
                                   to hit the right targets. They are focused on RAS mutations and companion drugs to combine with the RAS drugs 
                                   to reach the correct inhibition desired. They use an unique approach to blocking the activation of the kinase.
                                   They build a binder molecule that takes the activated kinase and binds it to cyclophilin A. This 
                                   prevents the activation of that kinase and its eventual degradation.

                                   I have followed Revolution Medicines and Mark Goldsmith for over a year now. I think he is doing a 
                                   good job with this company. They are out there talking about their science and how they are 
                                   different from others in this space. They have managed the balance sheet well. They recently did a secondary 
                                   in a really weak biotech market, and it was received well. They even have some early data to show they 
                                   are working through the drug development process. They have multiple drugs moving into early clinical trials now.
                                   It will take more time to see how their science translates into data.

                                   RMC-6236 targets multiple forms of RAS to include multiple KRAS targets. This is designed to be a pan inhibitor. 
                                   There is a lot of risk in this approach as any hitting of wild type RAS can come with serious side effects. The data shows 
                                   that upward of 30% of all cancers have a RAS mutation. This could affect well over 100,000 patients across multiple mutations.
                                   This is in early phase 1, and they announced some early safety data that shows its being well tolerated so far.

                                   RAS on form of KRAS. This is different from other KRAS G12C drugs. It does this by binding the KRAS to cyclophilin A. This

                                   RMC-4630 is a SHP2 inhibitor. This is the first kinase activated by the growth receptor inside cells. It starts 
                                   at the top of the MAPK pathway. This is designed to be a companion inhibitor to RAS drugs. This is currently in phase 
                                   1b trials in combination with other KRAS G12C inhibitors. The phase 1 data was encouraging, but it needs a dosing regimen 
                                   to keep tolerability. This program was given back to Revolution from Sanofi. They plan to continue to develop it on 
                                   their own for key KRAS combinations.

                                   RMC-6236 is the RAS multi drug with huge potential if the data works out. It could have a market size of 
                                   100,000 patients. Even if they get only 30% of that market at a $100,000 price, it comes out to $3 billion 
                                   in potential. I would give it a .1 multiplier which gives this program $300 million value.

                                   RMC-6291 is a KRAS G12C inhibitor. If RAS multi works, I don't think this gets much market share unless it combines

                                   I would only give this a small value amount since it requires RAS multi to combo well with it. I would give them $25
