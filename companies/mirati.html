                                   Mirati is developing kinase inhibitors focused on oncology. They have several drugs 
                                   in development targeting different pathways that drive cancer growth. There are many pathways 
                                   inside cells that can mutate and drive the growth of cancer cells. Finding these genetic 
                                   mutations and developing small molecule inhibitors to target those specific mutations is what 
                                   targeted therapy is all about.

                                   David Meek took over the CEO from Charles Baum last year. I know Charles was a founder 
                                   scientist so it makes sense they would bring in someone who knows commercial sales as they move into 
                                   being a commercial company. Only time will tell how well he does for taking the company into its next

                                   Adagrasib targets a mutation in a key growth pathway called KRAS G12C. The pathway is the RAS pathway 
                                   which is a key growth pathway in all cells. Mutations in this pathway drive uncontrolled cell growth. 
                                   KRAS is a form of RAS that affects tissues like the Lungs, Pancreas and Colon. There are different mutations 
                                   for KRAS with G12C making up about 32% of the KRAS mutation types. It's one of the most common and plays a big 
                                   role in NSCLC and CRC. It makes up about 14% of Lung Adenocarcinomas. The data for this program showed over 40%
                                   ORR and good CNS penetration as upward of 50% of KRAS NSCLC patients have brain mets.

                                   MRTX1133 targets another mutation of KRAS with the G12D mutation. This is the second most common type of KRAS 
                                   mutation representing about 23% of the KRAS mutations. This plays a larger role in Pancreatic cancer and less of 
                                   a role in NSCLC. This is in IND enabling studies with no data yet.

                                   Sitravatinib targets a family of kinases called the TAM family of kinases. This family shows strong promise at
                                   affecting cells within the tumor microenvironment. It has multiple benefits like shifting Macrophages back from 
                                   the M2 subtype to the M1 subtype which makes them able to target tumor cells. This is in a long term Overall Survival

                                   MRTX1719 is a PRMT5 inhibitor for MTAP deleted cancers. There is scientific evidence to show that MTAP deleted 
                                   cancers have a high dependence on PRMT5. This drug is designed to target those cancers by blocking this pathway 
                                   they have become dependent on. This is just starting phase 1 and has no data yet.

                                   Adagrasib affects KRAS G12C in NSCLC and CRC. This is about 10,000 patients in NSCLC, of which, they will compete with other companies 
                                   in this indication. I think they could get at least half of them since they have best in class data with CNS penetration.
                                   At a price of $200,000, that would be $1 billion in sales. I think it could expand to $1.5 billion if CRC is 
                                   successful. I would give this a 3x multiple on the $1 billion that is commercial. That is $3 billion in value.

                                   MRTX1133 affects KRAS G12D in Pancreatic and CRC. This is about 15,000 pancreatic and 10,000 CRC patients in the US.
                                   Depending on the data, this could get at least 50% of the market share for about 12,000 total patients. At a price of 
                                   $200,000, that would be $2.4 billion in sales. There will eventually be competitors in this space. I would give this 
                                   .1 multiple for being in preclinic. That is worth $240 million.

                                   types of cancer. I think this could be worth $1 billion in sales if it works out well. That would make it worth $100
