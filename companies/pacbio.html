                                   Pacific Bioscience is a sequencing company making machines for both long and short read 
                                   sequencing. They are developing 2 machines with 1 for long reads and 1 for short reads. They
                                   deploy a technology called Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing. This technology uses 
                                   chips where they place the DNA into the well along with nucleotides that are tagged with 
                                   fluorescence. There is a lens at the bottom of the well that will read the flashes of light for each base 
                                   as it is copied. They run this DNA in a circular fashion so it makes multiple passes around the 
                                   DNA. This allows them to build a consensus of the base for each nucleotide in the sequence. The 
                                   software then builds the sequence using the consensus.

                              Revio is their newest version of the long read sequencer. It has a lot of updates. It has the 
                              best accuracy of the long read sequencers. They can even read methylation patterns on the DNA using 
                              their sequencers. The Revio pushes the cost of sequencing to below $1,000 for long reads.

                                   technology for short reads.

                                   They currently have about $175 million in annual sales projected for 2023. The market for sequencing is estimated to double 
                                   from 2022 to 2026 from $7 billion to $14 billion. With 2 products now for both long and short sequencing, I think
                                   Pacbio could capture at least $1 billion in sales over time. At just 10x sales, that would be worth $5 billion 
                                   market cap. Their current value would be around $1.75 billion based on current sales.
