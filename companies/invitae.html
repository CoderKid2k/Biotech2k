                                   Invitae is a company that does genetic testing using kits. They test for things like Cancer 
                                   Genetics, Rare Genetic Disease and Women's Health. They generate over 3 million samples per year and
                                   continue to grow. This makes them like the Google of Genomics information. They allow patients to share their information
                                   which can lead to patients getting matched with doctors or scientists who are doing clinical trials
                                   that might apply to them. This can provide powerful population level genetics to scientists and 
                                   researchers alike who are doing research on these diseases.

                                   They just replaced their CEO last year with Ken Knight. So far I like his strategy to cut costs and 
                                   focus on growing the company in key markets. They have a lot of debt so he has a huge challenge ahead 
                                   of him. They just did a refinancing of their debt to 2028. They cut costs significantly from $850 million 
                                   a year in cash burn down to a projected $275 million for 2023. He has really turned around this company while 
                                   maintaining a good growth rate. They continue to grow revenues while cutting costs.

                                   The Oncology space of genetic testing is expected to grow to over $30 billion a year market size. There 
                                   is a huge genetics market for oncology as every tumor for every patient is unique. There is a need for 
                                   multiple tests per patient throughout their course of treatment. There is a high level of relapse rates 
                                   in cancer which will drive continued testing. The more we understand oncology the more important the 
                                   need for genetic profiling of tumors becomes. This space will only continue to grow as personalized 
                                   cancer treatments become more popular. One of the major current drivers of oncology is the Minimal 
                                   Residual Detection (MRD) of cancer.

                                   It's estimated that the Women's health space is about a $2.5 billion market. It's not the reason I 
                                   would own this company or any other testing company. The key focus is on oncology.
