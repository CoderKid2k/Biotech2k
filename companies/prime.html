                                   Prime is building the CRISPR system for Prime Editing. This takes the CAS9 nickase enzyme and 
                                   adds to it a Reverse Transcriptase enzyme from Retroviruses. This enzyme takes a RNA template, 
                                   which is part of the pegRNA. The Reverse Transcriptase enzyme will use the pegRNA to write from RNA
                                   into the DNA. The CAS9 nickase will cut a strand of DNA. Then the Reverse Transcriptase will copy
                                   the RNA template into the DNA. Then the DNA repair mechanisms will fix the DNA. I have big concerns
                                   about this technology as it has not been tested as extensively as it should be. The Reverse Transcriptase
                                   makes about 1 mistake every 100,000 bases. That might not sound like a lot, but when editing millions of 
                                   cells in a human, that is hundreds of mistakes that get introduced into a gene. There is no way to predict
                                   what kind of side effects could come from these many mutations.

                                   I have only followed this company since the IPO. It hasnâ€™t been very long. I have followed the CEO Keith 
                                   Gottesdiener when I was an investor in Rhythm Pharma. I think he did a good job over there so he does 
                                   get a level of trust that was earned developing another biotech company. Now we will have to wait and 
                                   see if he can repeat that success with this company.

                                   Friedreich's Ataxia is the first program they are working on. This is in the CNS which would be a problem for 
                                   delivery for this therapy. They would either have to invent a completely new LNP that works in the CNS, or they
                                   would need to use an AAV virus. That would be a real big problem as this system is way too big for any AAV.
                                   One of the major challenges all gene editing investors know is there is a huge obstacle for tissues. This would
                                   be one of those major obstacles for them to make this work.

                                   Cystic Fibrosis is another target they are focused on. This is in the lungs. We have seen many companies try to 
                                   deliver using LNP in the lungs, and they all failed badly. This is another indication where they lack delivery.
                                   They will need to find or invest in a new vector to make this work. This company will need to do a lot of inventing
                                   that isn't related to Prime Editing to make these programs work.

                                   Wilson's Disease is a rare disease where the body builds up too much copper in the organs which leads to
                                   damage. It is estimated to be about 2,000 to 3,000 patients in the US. I think they intend to deliver to the liver
                                   for this indication. I am not sure how they are trying to target this disease yet, but I would wonder how they plan
                                   to edit the liver and affect copper deposits in all organs. We will have to see how this develops.

                                   Chronic Granulomatous Disease is an extremely rare disease where Macrophages have a genetic defect which prevents
                                   them from being able to destroy the ingested pathogens they take in. It is estimated that only 20 people are born 
                                   CGD each year. Their approach is to edit iPSC stem cells to replace the defective stem cells. With this being a stem 
                                   cell therapy, all those errors by Reverse Transcriptase will be there forever to mutate and cause disease or cancer.

                                   Friedreich's Ataxia is estimated to be about 7,000 patients in the US. Even if they 1,000 of them at a $3 million
                                   price, that would be $3 billion. This has a very long way to go and many obstacles with delivery and the editing 
                                   technology. I would give this .1 multiplier for $300 million value.

                                   Cystic Fibrosis is about 30,000 patients in the US. I could see this being a good sized indication with $3 
                                   billion or more in sales. I think they could do at least 1,000 patients a year if the science works out. I would 
                                   give this a .1 multiplier for early preclinical. That makes it worth $300 million.
