                                   Blueprint is focused on targeted therapies for oncology. They have their main franchise around Mast Cell
                                   disorders with Ayvakit and Elenestinib. They are already commercial for Ayvakit for Advanced SM. They should
                                   be commercial in 2023 for Indolent SM. Elenestinib should expand this franchise into more Mast Cells applications.
                                   Their second franchise is around Lung Cancer targeting EGFR with 3 drugs in development. They have BLU-945, BLU-525 and BLU-451
                                   all targeting different variants of EGFR exon 19, 20 and 21. They just started a third franchise around Breast 
                                   Cancer with a CDK2 inhibitor. All of these are large areas of oncology.
                                   Their main focus has been on kinases that drive cell growth
                                   in cancer. They use mostly small molecule inhibitors, but recently started looking at protein degraders.

                                   Kate Haviland only took over last year as CEO, but she had been the COO under the management of Jeff Albers. Together, 
                                   they have developed a winning commercial biotech company. I think she is doing a good job and moving the 
                                   pipeline forward and bringing more drugs to commercial use.

                                   mature market for them with 75% of patients on Ayvakit. They will expand this drug if they get indolent SM approval. There has been very

                                   BLU-945 is an EGFR inhibitor which targets the L858R mutation of Exon 21 and the Exon 19 deletion. 
                                   This is the most common mutation of EGFR with 41% of patients being Exon 19 deletion and 32% being L858R Exon
                                   21 mutations. This drug targets the T790M and C797S mutations caused by Osimertinib. It's currently in 
                                   phase 1.

                                   insertions account for about 12% of EGFR mutations. We haven't seen any data from this program yet, but 
                                   we should see it this year.

                                   BLU-525 is their second L858 drug focused on Exon 21 mutations and Exon 19 deletions. This drug targets the 
                                   C797X mutations. It is designed to be more balanced at hitting both variants than BLU-945. This is in IND enabling 
                                   studies and should be ready for and IND this year.

                                   Ayvakit has about $200 million in annual sales right now with potential of upward of $750 million or more
                                   should they get approval in indolent SM which could have around 7,500 patients in the US. I would think they get 
                                   60% of those for 4,500. At a price of $100,000, that would reach $450 million sales. If you give
                                   them even 5x sales on their $200 million sales, this comes to $1 billion worth of value.

                                   Elenestinib could expand the applications into Mast Cell disorders to include Advanced and Indolent SM along 
                                   with other Mast Cell disorders. This could expand the population to another 10,000 patients. Even at 
                                   a $75,000 price, it would be worth another $750 million sales for them in Mast Cells. I would only give 
                                   this a 1x multiplier for being in phase 1. That makes it worth $750 million value.

                                   BLU-945 affects the most common forms of resistance to Osimertinib which does upward of $5 billion a year in sales.
                                   That makes the potential of this drug very big. The whole EGFR space is large with upward of 30% of Lung Cancer 
                                   patients having an EGFR mutation. I think this could do upward of $1 billion sales if the data is strong. I would 
                                   give it a .1 multiplier since its still needs data. That makes it a value of $100 million.

                                   with this mutation in Lung Cancer. Even at a $250,000 price, that could be worth about $500 million or more.
                                   I would give it a .1 multiplier until we see the data. That makes it worth $50 million.

                                   out as the data comes out. I think it could offer some additional treatment options. I would only 
                                   give this about $250 million in sales until I see how they are developing this. With a .1 multiplier, 
                                   that comes to $25 million value.
