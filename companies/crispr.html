                                   CRISPR is one of the original CRISPR CAS9 companies. They use the original CAS9 enzyme to do gene editing.
                                   Due to the possible risks of using a double stranded break in a person, they have focused on using the technology 
                                   for editing cells outside of humans like stem cell and T cell therapies. They are the most advanced company in 
                                   the CRISPR space. Their lead drug for SCD has been submitted for commercial approval. They recently started 
                                   to advance some early new programs around in-vivo gene knockout.

                                   I have followed Sam Kulkarni since 2018. I owned this for a long time, but I started to feel like they were 
                                   singularly focused on CTX-001 and had stopped innovating for a few years. Now that they are approaching 
                                   commercial launch, they have shifted focus back to clinical development. So far they are not showing 
                                   anything new compared to peers. I am still waiting for them to get back to leading the science and not 
                                   following the pack.

                                   Exa-cel is their lead program for SCD and Beta Thalassemia. This works by extracting the patient's stem cells and 
                                   editing them to flip the genetic switch back to making Fetal Hemoglobin. They treat the patients with Busulfan
                                   to get rid of all the old stem cells. Then they treat them with the new edited stem cells. It is a long and extensive
                                   process. This has very strong data at producing high levels 
                                   of Fetal Hemoglobin and eliminating Vaso Occlusive Crisis. This therapy has been submitted for FDA approval.

                                   CTX-110 is their first CAR-T therapy for CD19. It is an allogeneic therapy where they take donor T cells and 
                                   edit them before giving them to a patient. These cells don't have any advanced edits, and the data has been
                                   very weak compared to other allogeneic CAR-T programs. They have 67% ORR with only 28% responding at 6 months.

                                   CTX-130 is their second CAR-T therapy. It is an allogeneic therapy focused on CD70 in T cell Lymphomas. 
                                   They showed 70% ORR rate and 27% responding at 6 months. This still lacks the key 
                                   edits and the data is still on par with other allogeneic programs.

                                   VCTX-210 is their Diabetes therapy they are working on with ViaCyte. This program works on creating islet cells 
                                   from stem cell sources and placing them in a capsule that is inserted inside the body. This has some challenges 
                                   as the encapsulated islet cells have a hard time responding to insulin.

                                   Exa-cel is shared with Vertex with CRISPR getting only 40% of the revenues. I think they could do about 1,000 doses 
                                   per year to start and maybe ramp from there. At a price of $2.5 million, that would be worth $2.5 billion in revenues. 
                                   That would be $1 billion that would go to CRISPR. I would give them 3x multiple for a program awaiting approval. That makes 
                                   this program worth $3 billion in valuation.

                                   CTX-110 is in the space of CD19 which is very competitive. Based on its data compared to peers, I really would 
                                   not see this making much money if any at all. I gave it a $0 value.

                                   CTX-130 is in the space of CD70. I would guess this could have a patient population of at least 10,000. It would 
                                   depend on the data on how much market share. I would think this could be worth $1 billion revenues if successful.
                                   I would give this a .5 multiplier as it has some phase 1 data. That would make it worth $500 million in value.

                                   opt for this kind of implant. I give it no value until the data proves it works.
