                                   CRISPR is one of the original CRISPR CAS9 companies. They use the original CAS9 enzyme to do gene editing.
                                   Due to the possible risks of using a double stranded break in a person, they have focused on using the technology 
                                   for editing cells outside of humans like stem cell and T cell therapies. They are the most advanced company in 
                                   the CRISPR space. Their lead drug CTX-001 for SCD has been submitted for commercial approval in Europe and will 
                                   be submitted by end the of Q1 2023 in the US. They recently started to advance a broad pipeline of CAR-T cell therapies 
                                   using CRISPR gene editing. Their early data isn't very impressive, but there is always room for them to improve their edits.
                                   They anticipate to move forward their first in-vivo knockout program for ANGPLT3 for cholesterol.

                                   I have followed Sam Kulkarni since 2018. I owned this for a long time, but I started to feel like they were 
                                   singularly focused on CTX-001 and had stopped innovating for a few years. Now that they are approaching 
                                   commercial launch, they have shifted focus back to clinical development. They are working on multiple programs 
                                   for CAR-T which could always improve the data with newer edits. They are improving the SCD program by progressing 
                                   toward better conditioning. They are moving forward with hypoimmune beta cells for diabetes. They are also looking to advance 
                                   their fist in-vivo knock out program. Things are starting to pick up so it seems like the old CRISPR Therapeutics is 
                                   coming back.

                                   Exa-cel is their lead program for SCD and Beta Thalassemia. This works by extracting the patient's stem cells and 
                                   editing them to flip the genetic switch back to making Fetal Hemoglobin. They treat the patients with Busulfan
                                   to get rid of all the old stem cells. Then they treat them with the new edited stem cells. It is a long and extensive
                                   process. This has very strong data at producing high levels 
                                   of Fetal Hemoglobin and eliminating Vaso Occlusive Crisis. This therapy will be submitted for FDA approval soon. They 
                                   are also progressing with new conditioning with CD117.

                                   CTX-110 is their first CAR-T therapy for CD19. It is an allogeneic therapy where they take donor T cells and 
                                   edit them before giving them to a patient. These cells don't have any advanced edits, and the data has been
                                   very weak compared to other allogeneic CAR-T programs. They have 67% ORR with only 28% responding at 6 months.

                                   which are designed to increase potency of the CAR-T cells. They should be enrolling these in phase 1 soon.

                                   CTX-130 is their second CAR-T therapy. It is an allogeneic therapy focused on CD70 in T cell Lymphomas. 
                                   They showed 70% ORR rate and 27% responding at 6 months. This still lacks the key immune evading
                                   edits and the data is still on par with other allogeneic programs.

                                   program. I believe these cells have fitness edits, but they still lack the immune evasion edits and will still need

                                   Exa-cel is shared with Vertex with CRISPR getting only 40% of the revenues. I think they could do about 1,000 doses 
                                   per year to start and maybe ramp from there. At a price of $2.5 million, that would be worth $2.5 billion in revenues. 
                                   That would be $1 billion that would go to CRISPR. I would give them 3x multiple for a program awaiting approval. That makes 
                                   this program worth $3 billion in valuation.

                                   CTX-110 is in the space of CD19 which is very competitive. Based on its data compared to peers, I really would 
                                   not see this making much money if any at all. I gave it a $0 value.

                                   includes the Regnase-1 and TGFBR2 edits that are supposed to improve potency. If they are successful, this could produce 
                                   $250 million or more in revenues depending on data. I would give that a .1 multiplier since it has no clinical data. 
                                   That gives it a value of $25 million.

                                   CTX-130 is in the space of CD70. I would guess this could have a patient population of at least 10,000. It would 
                                   depend on the data on how much market share. I would think this could be worth $1 billion revenues if successful.
                                   I would give this a .5 multiplier as it has some phase 1 data. That would make it worth $500 million in value.

                                   sales for diabetes. CRISPR would only get 50% of those sales for $1 billion. I think the number of patients
                                   that would qualify for such a therapy would be only a small fraction 
                                   of those with a need for it. I give this a multiplier of .1 which gives it a value of $100 million
