                                   Sana is building 2 franchises around its delivery platform and its induced Pluripotent 
                                   stem cell therapies. Their delivery platform is about using virus-like particles with fusion proteins 
                                   in them to develop targeted delivery  to cells. This is a very interesting delivery platform. The big issue
                                   will be their manufacturing. They will need to make some breakthroughs on the technology to reach a 
                                   commercial scale for this kind of delivery system. The other platform is for making iPSC cells for cell therapies.
                                   This is where they take differentiated cells and turn them back into stem cells. Then they edit their DNA to make 
                                   master banks of cells for therapies. 
                                   They are focused on CAR-T therapies. They are developing other cell therapies around islet cells, liver cells, and 
                                   glial cells. They have hypoimmune edits for their cell therapies to mask these cells from 
                                   the immune system.

                                   I have been following Sana and Steve Harr for over a year now. I think he is a good CEO. He does 
                                   really well on science and presenting the science for the company. I do think he has been 
                                   overzealous on spending and recently had to cut back programs and spending. I am glad he was good 
                                   enough to react to the need, but I think he should have been cost wise from the beginning. They 
                                   are just entering the clinic now, and it will take time so see how well they manage the drug 
                                   development process.

                                   SC451 is an islet cell program where they create islet cells to produce insulin for diabetes. This is a very big 
                                   indication with over 1 million patients with a level of diabetes that might look for this kind of therapy. These cells
                                   are hypoimmune to avoid killing by the immune system. The one possible issue would be these cells becoming infected 
                                   with a virus as they won't have MHC to present antigens. They might need vaccinations prior to treatment or they 
                                   might include a switch to clear the cells should this happen.

                                   This would be only worth about $500 million sales unless they show best in class data. With it just entering phase

                                   SC262 is their CD22 program which will target B cell lymphomas. They will probably target patients

                                   data for a CD22 target in cell therapies. We will have to see how the data compares to CD19. It could be 
                                   better or worse. I would give a rough guess of $500 million similar to CD19 unless the data is very impressive.
                                   I would give it a .1 multiple for being preclinical. That is $50 million in value.
