                         <p>     
                              I am going to layer these topics for Human Leukocyte Antigens on top of each other with the first 
                              being a general high level overview. Then I will continue to stack on top of that getting deeper and 
                              deeper into the concepts of HLA. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              So what is this Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) anyway? Its a basic friend or foe identifier for our cells. 
                              Each cell gets stamped with a set of proteins that marks that cell as ours. I love to think of it as a 
                              barcode. If you have ever gone through the self checkout line at Walmart, you scan the barcode on each item. 
                              When you do, the computer knows that exact item you scanned was Smucker's Grape Jelly for $4.49. In the same way, 
                              our bodies stamp every cell we produce with a barcode of proteins that label it as ours. Each person will 
                              have a different barcode with a different set of proteins. Every cell in the body with a few exceptions 
                              gets stamped with this HLA barcode. So why is this important? This is used by our immune 
                              systems to  determine what is friendly and what is foreign. The immune cells are trained to ignore cells 
                              with the proper HLA codes. The immune system will attempt to attack an kill anything that lacks an HLA code or 
                              has the wrong HLA codes. This helps the immune system identify pathogens which want to invade us and use us 
                              to make more pathogens.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              In exchange, many pathogens learn to subvert the HLA of the cells by blocking its expression so they can 
                              hijack a cell and turn it into a pathogen factory. Its a constant battle between the immune system and 
                              pathogens. The other place this HLA barcode comes into play is in transplants. You probably see this all the 
                              time on TV doctor shows. They match 2 patients to see if they can be a donor. This is exactly how it sounds. 
                              They will test people to see if their HLA barcode matches the HLA of the person who needs the organ. The 
                              genes that encode these proteins are some of the most polymorphic in the human genome. There are potentially tens 
                              of thousands of combinations of the genes that make these HLA proteins. To be a match, they have to match 
                              every protein perfectly. There are 6 proteins on every cell that have to be matched. When the HLA does not 
                              match you have rejection. This comes in two kinds with Graft vs Host and Host vs Graft. This might sound 
                              complicated, but its not once I explain it.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              We stated the immune cells use the HLA to determine which cells are friendly or foreign and it tries to 
                              kill anything foreign. If you put immune cells from one person into another, they would not recognize that 
                              persons HLA and thus attack all their healthy cells. This is Graft vs Host. The transplanted cells are attacking 
                              the recipient. This is the case in stem cell transplants since stem cell produce the immune cells. In Host vs 
                              Graft rejection, the person who receives the cells will have their immune system target and kill those 
                              cells because the donor organ does not have the correct matching HLA.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="hlagenes">HLA Genes</h2>
                         <p> 
                              The HLA genes are located on the short arm of chromosome 6. They are a group of genes. We will focus 
                              on 6 of them, but there are many more. Some of them, we will cover in cell therapies. The first concept 
                              we must address is that of a haplotype. A haplotype is a group of genes that are inherited together.
                              They get inherited together from each parent. You get 1 of your mom's number 6 chromosomes and the exact 
                              copies of her HLA genes from that chromosome. You get 1 copy of your father's number 6 chromosomes and
                              the exact copies of his HLA genes from that chromosome. Barring any mutations, you get the exact same 
                              copy of these genes from a single parent chromosome. These genes are broken into 3 classes, of which, 
                              we will only focus on HLA class I and HLA class II genes.
                         </p>   
                         <p>
                              This is where I got to introduce another term called Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). What in the 
                              world is that? Its is an immunology term used to describe the proteins created by the Human Leukocyte 
                              Antigen (HLA) genes. When we are speaking of the genes or the alleles of those genes, we use the HLA. 
                              When we are referring to the proteins made from those genes that get used by the immune system, 
                              we call them MHC. The HLA genes will be dividend into 2 classes with HLA Class I and HLA class II. 
                              These genes create the MHC proteins which are named the MHC Class I and MHC Class II proteins. So 
                              remember HLA = the genes and MHC = the proteins made by those genes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are 3 genes that fall under HLA class I titled HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C. No points for creativity 
                              there. These 3 genes encode 3 different proteins of Class I MHC. Thre are potentially thousands of alleles 
                              for each of these HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genes. Since you get 2 chromosomes 6's, with
                              one from mom and one from dad, you end up with 6 total HLA Class I genes. That means every cell has 2 each 
                              of HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C proteins. Most likely they are all from different alleles with one copy of each 
                              coming from each parent. In the best case scenario, we would want our mom and dad's HLA genes to be different
                              as this would allow us to present more possible antigens to our immune system. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              There are also 3 genes that fall under HLA class II which are titled HLA-DP, HLA-DQ and HLA-DR. They 
                              also encode another 3 MHC proteins. These are the Class II proteins. These MHC II proteins are only used by immune 
                              cells. While the MHC I proteins are on every cell as a barcode of friend or foe, the MHC II proteins are 
                              only used by immune cells to present pathogens to the T helper cells to activate the adaptive immune 
                              response. With the MHC II genes you get a copy of each of these HLA-DP, HLA-DQ and HLA-DR from each parent.
                              gives your immune cells 2 of each of these proteins with one coming from each parent. That means these immune cells
                              with have a total of 6 MHC II proteins. Since they are cells, most of the immune cells present all 6 MHC I and 
                              all MHC II proteins. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The variation for each of these genes is vast. These genes have the most variation in the entire human genome. The 
                              HLA-A gene has over 4,000 known alleles. The HLA-B gene has over 5,000 known alleles. The HLA-C gene has nearly 
                              4,000 known gene alleles. The HLA class II genes with HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR have fewer 
                              possiblities, but they actually each have 2 genes that make each protein of the MHC II. One gene that 
                              encodes an alpha chain protein and one that 
                              encodes a beta chain protein. Those 2 chains come together to form the actual HLA protein. There are fewer alleles for 
                              these genes, but due to them having 2 actual genes for each of these MHC proteins, they have a lot of variation. 
                              There are over 12,000 different Haplotypes known for HLA. That means 1 in 12,000 people 
                              will have a match for their HLA haplotypes. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              If you didn't think that was hard enough, the naming of each of these alleles for these genes doesn't get 
                              any easier. You will see a name like HLA-A*02:101:01:02N. Ya, that looks complicated, but we only need to understand 
                              the first few parts of these names to understand how HLA alleles work. The first part, the HLA-A, you already know 
                              as we just covered them. The part after the asterisk is the first key number. That is called the Field and its 
                              the number for the allele of protein that gets coded. The numbers beyond that sub divide that field, but they are 
                              not as important. The HLA-A*02 is a key allele of the HLA-A gene as its one of the most common to participate in 
                              rejection with T cells. When it comes to the HLA class II genes, you will see something like HLA-DPA and HLA-DPB for 
                              the alpha and beta chains that make up the HLA-DP protein.  
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When we talk about HLA alleles from parents, we might have HLA-A*02 from mom and HLA-A*04 from dad. That is 
                              how the allele of these genes are classified. This would be similar in the HLA-B and HLA-C genes with them followed 
                              by an asterik and a number. Even the HLA class II genes are similar. You could have HLA-DPA*01 and HLA-DPB*02 from mom 
                              for one of your set of alleles and HLA-DPA*04 and HLA-DPB*01 for the other set. Just remember the MHC I proteins are 
                              only 1 protein made from 1 gene while the MHC II protiens are 2 chains from 2 genes that make up their proteins.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="mhc1">Major Histocompatibility Complex I</h2>
                         <p>  
                              We talked about the genes that encode the proteins that make up the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). 
                              Now we will look at the proteins themselves. First we will look at the structure of the MHC I as it is the most 
                              important in rejection and makes up that barcode that identifies cells as friendly. There are 3 HLA genes 
                              that encode the 3 MHC proteins. They are HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C. The cell will make all 3 of these proteins. 
                              It will make them from both mom's chromosome as well as dad's chromosome. They might be different genes like 
                              HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*04, but the protein structures will have the same basic shape and functions.

                              The MHC I proteins are made up of domains linked together. Each domain is part of the alpha chain which is made 
                              up of 3 domains called the a1, a2 and a3 domains. There is a beta chain called the Beta 2 Microglobulin or B2M.
                              The B2M chain is made by a commone gene which makes the B2M protein. That protein gets used with every alpha chain.
                              Its a generic protein that does not change. That means you will have genes to code the alpha chains, but they will 
                              all pair with a common B2M protein. This is an important concept and it distinguishes MHC I from MHC II 
                              which has genes for both the alpha and beta chains.

                              The MHC I has a structure that looks like a 4 leaf clover. The alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains would make up the top 
                              2 leaves. The binding pocket sits right between the alpha 1 and alpha 2 connection. This is where the antigens bind. 
                              The bottom 2 leaves of the 4 leaf clover would make up the alpha 3 domain and the B2M that anchor the MHC I protien 
                              to the cell surface. The cell is constantly breaking down old proteins into fragments. The pieces from these proteins 
                              are called peptides. They bind into the pocket of the MHC I. Then they are carried to the cell surface and displayed 
                              for the immune system to see. These will be friendly protein fragments so the T cells will not respond. When the cell 
                              gets infected, some of the pathogens proteins will get broken down and display using the MHC I. Then the T cells will 
                              see those antigens and respond by killing the infected cell.
                         </p>   
                         <p>
                              The antigens bind to binding groove between the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domain. Each and every different allele of 
                              HLA-A would encode a different alpha chain which will recognize a differt antigen in its binding groove. For example the HLA-A*02 you got 
                              from mom might recognize antigens with Leucines in it while the HLA-A*04 you got from dad might recognize antigens 
                              with Valine. This leads to diversity in our body for presenting antigens. The more variation we have in our MHC I proteins 
                              the more antigens we can possible present to the T cells to mount a response. This also account for why one person might 
                              not respond well to a virus while another person might respond really well.
