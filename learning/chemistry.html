                         <p>
                              It is the study of the physical elements. It is about what atoms are made of and how they 
                              become the building blocks of everything on Earth including us. It is about how these 
                              molecules combine, react and change in relationship to each other. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Elements are the basic substances that make up all things. They include things like Carbon, Oxygen, 
                              Gold and Chlorine. All the elements are listed in the Periodic Table of elements. The periodic table 
                              is a very nice diagram that lists all the elements on Earth according to their properties.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The most basic unit of any element is a single atom. If you were to take a chunk of gold and keep 
                              breaking it into pieces until you had the smallest possible piece that still resembles that element, 
                              that would be a single atom of gold. The most common element you will deal with in biology will be 
                              carbon. Everything living on earth is built on a carbon structural backbone. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The number of protons in the atom is what determines what element that atom will be. If it has 6 protons, 
                              it will always be carbon. If it has 8, it will always be oxygen. You can not change the number of 
                              protons in an atom without changing which element it will be. On the periodic table, the number is the 
                              number of protons that element has.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The atom is made up of 3 basic components: the proton, the neutron and the electron. The protons and 
                              neutrons make up the center of the atom called the nucleus. They each weigh about 1 Atomic Mass 
                              Unit (AMU). The electrons orbit around the nucleus and they weigh next to nothing. The protons have 
                              a positive charge, the electrons have a negative charge and the neutrons are neutral. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Each proton and neutron weighs about 1 Atomic Mass Unit (AMU). The electrons have such low weight that 
                              they are not counted for the weight of that element. The atomic weight of any element is the protons plus 
                              the neutrons. Not all elements will have equal amounts of protons and neutrons.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some elements will have more neutrons than others. These are called isotopes. They still have the same 
                              protons so they are the same element, but they have different amounts of neutrons which gives them 
                              different atomic mass. A good example of this is Carbon. Most of the carbon on Earth has 6 protons and 
                              6 neutrons and weighs 12 atomic mass units. There is an isotope of carbon that has 6 protons and 8 
                              neutrons. This is called carbon 14. It weighs 14 atomic mass units.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Most atoms are neutrally charged which means they have the same number of electrons as they have protons, 
                              but many will become ions as they gain or lose electrons through reactions. If an atom has more protons 
                              than electrons, it will become positively charged. If it has more electrons than protons, it will become 
                              negatively charged. A positively charged ion is called a cation. A negatively charged ion is called an 
                              anion. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The electrons orbit the nucleus and they have a negative charge which holds them in orbit as they are 
                              attracted to the positive charge of the protons in the nucleus. The nucleus makes up more than 99% of 
                              the weight, but it's so small that it only takes up a tiny fraction of the atom's space. This is caused 
                              because the electrons of one atom will repel the electrons of another atom. That makes the vast majority 
                              of the atomâ€™s space empty. It's only through reactions can an electron be added, removed or exchanged 
                              with another atom.
                         </p>

                    <section>
                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="electrons">Electron Configurations</h2>
                         <p>
                              In most chemistry books, you see pictures of the electrons in their orbitals that look like planets 
                              orbiting the moon in the solar system. The truth about electrons is they buzz around the nucleus like 
                              flies buzzing around a light bulb at night. The orbitals we use to represent the electrons are more of 
                              a general area in which these electrons will be zipping around. There are 4 types of electron orbitals 
                              with S, P, D and F orbitals. In organic chemistry, the outer shell of the electrons will always have a 
                              max of 8 electrons made up of 1 S and 3 P orbitals. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first  orbital is the S orbital which can only hold 2 electrons. Then will come the 3 P orbitals 
                              which can each hold 2 more electrons each for a total of 6 electrons. There are 2 spots in each of the 
                              P orbitals that can be filled with electrons. You can have 2 in each of the P orbitals which are Px, Py 
                              and Pz. This concept can get complicated very quickly. The key is there are 8 electrons that can appear 
                              in the outermost shell of the atom. They will be made up of 2S and 6P orbital electrons. When you get to 
                              the elements with D and F orbitals, they will always backfill to the inner shells so that only 8 
                              electrons are in the outermost shell. The periodic table is very helpful for you to use as a reference 
                              to figure out where the electrons go. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The periodic table can be a bit intimidating at first, but it becomes a very powerful tool to figure out 
                              electron configurations once you get used to how it works. Electrons have energy shells and orbitals 
                              within each energy shell. There are 7 energy shells starting with the 1 energy shell and going to the 7 
                              energy shell. The lower level energy shells have less orbitals than the higher level energy shells. The 
                              rows of the periodic table represent the energy shell from 1 through 7. The columns represent the 
                              orbitals. There are 4 types of orbitals with the S, P, D and F orbitals. The way to express these energy 
                              shells and orbitals are like 1S or P5. The letter is the orbital and the number is the energy shell. An 
                              element will contain all the energy shells and orbitals of all the elements before it, but it will have 1 
                              extra electron.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The columns are a bit confusing at first in the periodic table as not every row (energy shell) includes all 
                              the possible columns which represent the orbitals from S, P, D and F.  The first P orbital doesnâ€™t start 
                              until the second energy shell 2P. The D orbitals donâ€™t start until the fifth energy shell, but they back 
                              fill the 4D energy shell orbitals. The F orbitals donâ€™t start until the seventh energy shell and also 
                              back fill the 6F energy shell orbitals. When we deal with biology, biochemistry and organic chemistry, 
                              we will deal mostly with the lower energy shells with the S and P orbitals in them. We wonâ€™t deal much 
                              if at all with D or F orbitals.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The lowest energy shell starts with just 1 orbital which is the S orbital. Each orbital contains up to 2 
                              electrons. Every shell will have an S orbital all the way from the 1 energy shell to the 7 energy shell. 
                              The first energy shell row is represented with just 2 elements in Hydrogen and Helium. This 1 energy 
                              shell has only 1 S orbital with 2 electrons in it. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The second row in the periodic table is the 2 energy shell. It includes the 2 electrons from the 1S shell 
                              plus 2 electrons from 2S and up to 6 electrons in the 3 P orbitals of the 2nd energy shell in the second 
                              row of the table. The 2 columns on the far left of the table represent the 2 electrons in the S orbitals 
                              for each energy shell. They contain elements like Lithium, Calcium, Sodium and Potassium. All of these 
                              elements have all their inner energy shells full plus 1 or 2 electrons in their outermost energy shell 
                              in the S orbital.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The 6 columns on the far right represent the 6 electrons in the P orbitals. There are actually 3 P orbitals 
                              called Px, Py and Pz. Each one holds just 2 electrons each. The columns on the far right represent 
                              those 6 electrons for the P orbitals. These elements include things like Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, 
                              Phosphate and Sulfur which are used in biochemistry. All these elements will have all their inner energy 
                              shells filled up to this point in the chart plus they will have some or all of their electrons full in 
                              their P orbitals.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Carbon is a good example. It contains all the electrons of all the elements before it. That means it 
                              has 2 electrons in its 1S energy shell, it has the 2 electrons in its S2 orbital of the 2 energy shell 
                              and it has 2 electrons in the P2 energy shell of the P orbitals. That means it has a total of 6 electrons 
                              with  1S2, 2S2, and 2P2 electrons. This is how we write the electron configuration of any element. We 
                              notate each orbital of each shell in order with 2 electrons in each orbital. You will see each orbital 
                              of P written out like 1S2, 2S2, 2Px2, 2py2 and 2pz2. Most of the time, people will consolidate the P 
                              orbital by just using 2P6. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When you write out the electrons for that element you will write each orbital for each shell and how many 
                              electrons it has. The first number will always be the shell, the second will be the letter for that 
                              specific orbital, and the last number will be the number of electrons occupying that orbital. If we are 
                              writing carbon, we will have 2 electrons in the first shell which is 1S2. Then we will have 2 electrons 
                              in the S orbital of the second shell 2S2. Finally we will have 2 electrons in the P orbital of the second 
                              shell for 2P2. This makes carbon's electron configuration 1S2, 2S2, 2P2. That means carbon has 6 total 
                              electrons which matches its protons for a neutral element. When you write these, you will write the 
                              electrons in an elevated position like an exponent.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="bonding">Electron Bonding</h2>
                         <p>
                              The term valence electron is used to describe just the electron configuration of the outermost shell 
                              of the atom. When atoms bond or react, it's all going to happen based on the amount of electrons in 
                              the outermost shell. We call them the Valence electrons or Valency for short. Every atom will be 
                              unhappy with less than 8 electrons in that outer shell. Everyone wants a full shell of electrons. 
                              This is what drives chemical bonding. This desire of atoms to exchange electrons so they can all have 
                              8 electrons in that outermost shell. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Based on the number of electrons in the outermost shell, you can quickly figure out what kind of bonds 
                              that element will like to make. Carbon has 4 electrons in the outermost shell. That means it has a 
                              valency of 4. It can gain or lose 4 electrons in bonding to stabilize its outermost shell. The oxygen 
                              has 6 of 8 electrons in its outermost shell. It has a valency of 6. It will often make 2 bonds with 
                              other elements to gain or share those missing 2 electrons. This can be seen in pure oxygen with 2 
                              Oxygen atoms double bonded to each other. They both share 2 electrons with each other. In water, the 
                              oxygen shares 1 electron with 2 of each hydrogen atoms. This is the case in H2O.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When we do the dot structures to represent an atom, we will often use the symbol of the element as the 
                              center. Then we will place 1 dot around that center for each valence electron. With Oxygen it has 6 dots 
                              for its 6 electrons. Any double lines indicate the 2 atoms are sharing a pair of electrons. This allows 
                              each atom of oxygen to have that perfect 8 electrons as it shares 2 of its own for 2 of its neighbors. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When two atoms share electrons in some capacity, we call this bonding. There are two main different kinds 
                              of bonds with Ionic bonds and Covalent bonds. The difference between these two bonds is the level at 
                              which the electrons are shared. We call this electronegativity. Some elements will hog electrons while 
                              others will try to give them away.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Ionic bonds come from the term ions. This is when two atoms of opposite charges bind together. This is 
                              the classic opposites attract. Most ionic bonds happen when an element with few electrons gives them away 
                              to another element that needs just a few more to fill its valence shell. The classic example of an ionic 
                              bond is NaCL or table salt.  Sodium only has 1 electron in its outer shell. It would be really happy to 
                              give it away so it can have a full shell of 1 lower energy level. This makes the sodium positively 
                              charged. It gives that electron to Chlorine which has 7 electrons in its outer shell. It would love 
                              nothing more than to have 1 extra. It takes that electron from the Sodium and becomes negatively charged 
                              with a full octet of electrons in its outer shell. These 2 ions will then bind together in an ionic bond 
                              as the positively charged sodium sticks to the negatively charged chlorine. When placed in water, these 
                              two ions will easily drift apart into their separate ionic elements.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Ionic bonds love to happen between the elements on the left side of the periodic table in the first two 
                              columns where they only have 1 or 2 electrons. They will often donate their electrons to elements in 
                              column 6 or 7 where they need 1 or 2 extra electrons.  
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The second type of bond is called the covalent bond. This is where two atoms bind together and share 
                              electrons equally. The large number of bonds in biochemistry are held together using covalent bonds. 
                              They are strong bonds that require a good deal of energy to break. These are the bonds used to build 
                              many of the chemical structures we deal with from sugar (glucose) to hydrocarbons. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When dealing with covalent bonds, you can quickly know how many bonds an atom will have based on 
                              how many electrons it has in its valence electrons. The carbon atom needs 4 electrons. They can share 
                              2 with each other indicated by a double bond symbol. Then the carbons can share a single electron  each 
                              with 2 hydrogens. When dealing with bonds, you have to learn the concept of electronegativity. The 
                              molecule described here would be Ethene. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Each element will have a different desire to be an electron hog. This desire increases across the 
                              periodic chart from the lower left to the upper right. The elements at the upper right are electron 
                              hogs. When they share electrons with another atom, they hog that electron, causing one atom to become 
                              slightly negatively charged while the other becomes slightly positively charged. This is called a polar 
                              molecule. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              In a polar molecule, one end becomes positively charged and the other end negatively charged. Water is 
                              used as the classic polar molecule. Oxygen is a massive electron hog. It takes the electrons from the 
                              hydrogens causing the hydrogens to become positive while the oxygen has 8 electrons becoming negatively 
                              charged. These polar elements are very common in biochemistry as proteins often fold using electrostatic 
                              charges from these polar elements. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This brings us to the concept of hydrogen bonding. This is used as the concept of water, but it can apply 
                              to other elements. Water is such a polar molecule that one molecule of water will bind to another 
                              molecule of water with the positive hydrogens binding to the negative oxygens and the negative oxygens 
                              binding to the positive hydrogens. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This power of hydrogen bonds is the weakest of bonds, but yet still strong enough to let a bug walk 
                              across the surface of the water. The most important use of hydrogen bonds in biochemistry is the 
                              hydrogen bonds that bind the 2 strands of the DNA together. 
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="states">States of Matter</h2>
                         <p>
                              All matter exists in three states of solid, liquid and gas. The difference between these three states is 
                              temperature. Many elements will not exist in all three states here on Earth. Water is the most common to 
                              exist in all three states. Water can exist as ice, water or steam. What changes the state is the amount 
                              of temperature affecting the water. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When an element is in the solid state, its atoms will be more compact and dese then when it is in the 
                              liquid state. In the same way, a gas will be far less dense and compact than a liquid. The only substance 
                              on Earth that is different is water. When water freezes to become ice, its atoms actually spread out and 
                              become less dense. This is why ice floats. It is less dense than the actual water. 
                              The temperature at which an element turns to solid is called its freezing point. The temperature at which 
                              it goes from liquid to gas is its boiling point. Going from a gas to a liquid is called condensation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Gases are substances in a state that can freely expand to fill a container and have no fixed shape. These 
                              atoms are moving at a high rate of speed, and they are usually very far apart from each other. When a gas 
                              is placed into a container, the atoms will zip around bouncing off each other and the sides of the 
                              container. The amount of  atoms bouncing off the side of the container is measured as pressure. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are several concepts that make gases easy to understand. The pressure is the measure of how many atoms 
                              bounce off the sides of the container. You might see this measured in pounds per square inch. The more 
                              atoms you put into the container the higher the pressure will become as more atoms will bounce off the 
                              sides of the container. The size of the container will cause the pressure to change. A smaller container 
                              has less room so will have a higher pressure with the same amount of atoms inside. A bigger container 
                              will have more room so the atoms won't bounce around as much so the pressure would be lower. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first rule of gases says that pressure is inversely linked to the volume. 
                              If you put a million air molecules into a container, the pressure will be 
                              higher should the container become smaller. To get the same pressure in a 
                              larger container, you would have to increase the amount of atoms. Temperature 
                              causes the atoms to speed up. That means they can bounce off the sides of the 
                              container more often. Temperature affects pressure. A higher temperature speeds 
                              up atoms and increases pressure. A lower temperature will cause the atoms to 
                              slow down and the pressure will decrease. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All matter is broken down in pure substances or mixtures. A pure substance can be an element. In 
                              an element, all atoms are the exact same like gold, silver or oxygen. A compound is made up of more 
                              than one element like sugar or water. Water is made up of 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen atom. A mixture 
                              is made up of substances, and they come in two kinds. When all of the elements or compounds are equally 
                              distributed throughout the mixture, it's called a homogeneous mixture. This often happens in solutions 
                              like a solution of salt water. The salt will dissolve and mix through the water solution. When the 
                              mixture is made up of two substances that don't mix well, it is called a heterogeneous mixture. This can 
                              be demonstrated by mixing dirt and sand. If you mix dirt with sand, you will get a different balance 
                              between the two substances through the mixture.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A solution is the mixing of an element into a liquid. The most common solution 
                              we will use is water. Water makes a great solvent and solution. You can mix all 
                              kinds of solutions in water. You might make a solution of salt water or a 
                              solution of bleach and water. The mix of a solution is always measured in a 
                              percentage. The first concept of a solution is solubility. This is the idea of can this element be 
                              dissolved into the solvent. Oil and water will not mix and make a solution. Oil will mix with gasoline. 
                              Solubility is to know if the solute will even work with the solvent. The composition of the solution is 
                              measured in a percentage. You might see vinegar is a 5% solution of acetic acid. The more the 
                              concentration of the solute in the solvent the higher the percentage will be. Many times the solution is 
                              done by moles. You might put 1 mole of acetic acid into 5 moles of water. This is how many solutions are 
                              mixed and measured. This is then called molarity of the solution.

                              Many reactions will require the input of heat to make them work. We call them 
                              endothermic reactions. Some reactions will release heat. We call them exothermic reactions. Think of 
                              burning wood for a campfire to stay warm or cooking food. This is a reaction that releases heat.

                              Since exothermic and endothermic reactions happen between the substances and the surrounding 
                              environment, most of thermochemistry is about measuring the amount of energy that is required or 
                              released. This is often measured in Joules or Calories. Yes, the calorie is a measure of heat released. 
                              A calorie is the amount of energy required to take 1 gram of water and raise its temperature 1 degree 
                              celsius. This comes out to about 4.18 joules.

                              Heat capacity is the ability of any substance to conduct heat. Water has a great use for heat capacity. 
                              It takes a long time for water to heat or cool compared to its environment. One of the many amazing 
                              attributes of water is to transfer heat. Even our bodies cool themselves by releasing water as sweat. 
                              Things like metals and glass can have a high capacity to transfer heat. Specific heat is the term used 
                              to define how much energy it takes to increase that substance by 1 degree.

                              We will see formulas in chemical reactions. There are a few basic concepts to understand when looking 
                              at a formula. The first will be the reactants followed by a reaction symbol then the products. The 
                              reaction symbol will be an arrow or 2 arrows depending if that reaction happens in one direction or 
                              both directions.

                              The reaction listed above is for the chemical reaction that turns glucose and oxygen into carbon dioxide, 
                              water and energy for cells. On the left side are the reactants. The reactants are the glucose as C6H12O6 
                              which is added to the Oxygen (O2) we breathe in. This is oxygen and glucose is then taken by cells and 
                              broken down into energy creating water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The right side of the equation 
                              shows the products. The arrow in the reaction is pointing in only one direction.

                              The reaction used in our blood to regulate the pH of the blood by mixing ratios of carbon dioxide and 
                              water to with a buffer called carbonic acid regulates blood pH. On the left side of the equation is the 
                              carbonic acid that works as the buffer for regulating pH. It can move to the right to become bicarbonate 
                              and hydrogen ions. The more hydrogens the higher the acidity of the blood. This reaction has two arrows 
                              going in both directions. This means the reaction can go back and forth in both directions based on the 
                              quantities of each element.

                              These are two very practical chemical reactions to help you get used to seeing and understanding how 
                              reactions work without getting into a ton of complex chemistry you will probably never use unless you 
                              become an actual chemist.

                         <p>
                              Reactions that deal with reduction and oxidation are called Redox reactions.They are one of the most 
                              important kinds of reactions. This is actually part of acid-based chemistry. It's all about tracking 
                              the movement of electrons during a reaction.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There is an easy mnemonic we can use here to remember reduction and oxidation (redox) reactions. Its 
                              OIL RIG. OIL stands for Oxidation is Losing an electron. RIG stands for Reduction is Gaining an 
                              electron. The atom which gains the electron is being reduced. The atom that is losing the electron is 
                              being oxidized. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Acid-based chemistry is the most common that will be used in biology. I am not going to waste your 
                              time going over the classic naming of every kind of acid. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Acids and Bases are measured on a pH scale. This measures the amount of hydrogen ions. The higher the 
                              hydrogen ions the stronger the acid. The pH scale is what is called an inverse log. That means the 
                              numbers go lower as the concentration of hydrogen ions goes up while the numbers go higher as the 
                              hydrogen ions go lower. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The scale of pH goes from 0 to 14. The neutral point is 7. As the numbers go lower than 7, the 
                              hydrogen ions increase. As the numbers go higher from 7, the hydrogen ions decrease. The key 
                              components of an acid is H+ ions. These are hydrogen atoms who lost their electrons to become 
                              positive. The opposite of a base is an increase in Hydroxide ions which are OH-. Notice what happens 
                              when an acid ion H+ comes together with a base ion of OH-? They form water to become neutral. In 
                              biology, you will deal a lot with the balance between Hydrogen ions and Hydroxide ions to balance out 
                              pH.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are a few different actual definitions of what is an acid and a base. The one we will use is the 
                              one that applies best in biology. An acid is a substance that gives off a H+ ion while the base is the 
                              substance that accepts that H+ ion. The first thing you will notice about this definition is not all 
                              bases are hydroxide (OH-) ions. Ammonia is a Nitrogen bound to 3 hydrogens (NH3). Clearly, you would 
                              think something with all those Hydrogens would be an acid, but NH3 can always accept a 4th hydrogen to 
                              become NH4. That makes it a very weak base.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A strong acid is something that can completely dissociate in water while a weak acid is something that 
                              does not dissociate well in water. Typically in a weak acid you will see those double arrows between 
                              the products and reactants as they can go back and forth. A strong acid will break apart and not want 
                              to go back the other way. It will have a clear reaction arrow that points in only one direction.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              When an acid reacts with a base, it will create a new set of products. These new products are 
                              the opposite of how they started. An acid will become the conjugate base while the Base will 
                              become the conjugate acid. This helps us define a strong acid vs a weaker acid. The stronger an 
                              acid is, the weaker its conjugate base will be. That means it's less likely that the base will 
                              be able to go back the other way in the reaction. The weaker the acid is, the stronger its 
                              conjugate base will be. That means that base will be more likely to go back in the other 
                              direction. A really strong acid will break apart and never want to reverse the reaction.

                         <p>
                              When we deal with biology and biochemistry, we will focus on a handful of key elements. Most of life 
                              on Earth is built of these key elements and getting to know them will be very helpful for organic 
                              chemistry. They are Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphate and Sulfur. They make the great 
                              acronym CHNOPS. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Carbon is the most essential element in biology. Many of the biological structures are built from a 
                              carbon backbone. Carbon has 4 valence electrons. That means it wants to make 4 bonds to get to the 
                              octet it desires to fill its outer shell. Whenever you see Carbon, you should easily count the amount 
                              of bonds it has. We often draw these elements using a dot structure where we only track the electrons 
                              in the outer shell. These will be the electrons that will participate in reactions.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              When we look at chemical structures in organic chemistry, they can be a bit confusing because they use 
                              line diagrams. We only draw the carbons by indicating a line between 2 carbons. The hydrogens do not 
                              get drawn out. We only indicate molecules that are not hydrogen or carbon such as nitrogen or oxygen. 
                              The carbons are not marked as the lines indicate they exist. The hydrogens are not marked as the bond 
                              indicates the number of hydrogens each carbon will have.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              Carbons in a chain get numbered. They are numbered by the longest chain of carbons in the molecule. 
                              Carbons make up long chains of hydrocarbons and fatty acids in biology. They get named with prefixes 
                              to indicate how many carbons are in the chain like pentane or octane. The suffix for a carbon chain 
                              comes from what kinds of bonds it contains. Single bonds in a carbon chain are called -anes like 
                              Propane. A double bonded set of carbons is called an -ene like Pentene. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              In Biology, we name them by their position in the chain and use the Prime indicator. This applies when 
                              we name a carbon in DNA or RNA to indicate its position in the carbon chain. This mainly affects the 
                              Ribose sugars of the DNA and RNA. When we say the 3rd prime carbon, we refer to the 3rd carbon in the 
                              ribose sugar. You will see this prime term used in biology and genetics for naming a specific carbon 
                              in a chain of carbons.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              Carbons can come in rings. This is a very frequent structure used in drugs. Many molecules are made 
                              up of one or many rings of carbons bound together. A carbon ring is called a cyclo prefix. So a 5 
                              carbon chain is pentane, but a 5 carbon ring is cyclopentane. The hardest part of dealing with ringed 
                              carbon structure is knowing which is the fist carbon so you can figure out their numbering. Usually 
                              the largest ring is numbered first.
                         </p>

                              Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements in the entire universe, let alone biology. Hydrogens 
                              play a key role in hydrophobic (water hating) and hydrophilic (water loving) forces. The hydrogens 
                              often carry a slightly negative charge due to electronegativity so will repel each other. They will 
                              try to separate themselves in water which is made up of hydrogens. This is what causes oil 
                              (Hydrocarbons) to separate while in water. In this same way, elements with many hydrogens will 
                              separate themselves in the water of biological systems. The most common we deal with in biology is 
                              fatty acids and lipids. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The hydrogen atom is made up of 1 proton and 1 electron. Because it only has one possible shell with 
                              the S1 energy shell, it will love to give away an electron. If it gives away its electron, this will 
                              create a positively charged ion that will be used in acid based chemistry. Hydrogen will also seek to 
                              share an electron with another element as it only needs one more to fill its energy shell. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When carbons are chained together, they will fill themselves with hydrogens to fill any bonds they are 
                              missing. These are called hydrocarbon structures. When structures are drawn in organic chemistry, the 
                              hydrogens are not drawn. They are implied. We know that all carbons that lack 4 bonds will fill those 
                              with hydrogens. We can infer from this rule that any carbon that does not have those 4 bonds will have 
                              hydrogens. All you have to do is look at each carbon and count how many bonds it has. Anything less 
                              than 4 will mean it has hydrogens filling those positions. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              In some parts of biology, the nitrogen element will build structures instead of carbon. This is seen in 
                              the DNA. The bases of nucleic acids are built of nitrogen structures. We call them nitrogenous bases. 
                              Nitrogen is one of the key components in the amino group which is in turn a key component in all amino 
                              acids. The amino group is a nitrogen with 2 or 3 hydrogens attached.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Nitrogen has 5 electrons in its outer shell. That means it likes to make 3 other bonds to fill its 
                              shell to a full octet. When you count bonds in any structure for nitrogen, you want to count 3 bonds. 
                              Most of the time nitrogen will be filled with hydrogens like carbon when it lacks any of its 3 bonds. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The use of nitrogen in biochemistry is the amino group. This is a nitrogen connected to one other 
                              molecule symbolized by a R. Then it fills itself with 2 hydrogens to fill the rest of its bonds. It is 
                              not uncommon to see amino groups with 3 hydrogens when it is not attached to another molecule. This 
                              group can be a reactive group as hydrogen can be displaced and replaced with another molecule to 
                              create bonding. This is exactly what is done when the amino acid chains are created. A hydrogen is 
                              removed and replaced with the carbon of the next amino acid. The nitrogen then links directly to the 
                              carbon.

                              The oxygen element is critical for life as we breathe in O2 and it drives many of the human body's 
                              reactions. Plants and animals have a symbiotic relationship on Earth as plants take carbon dioxide and 
                              water and produce oxygen and glucose. The animals take the water and glucose and produce carbon dioxide 
                              and water. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Oxygen is one of the most reactive elements in biology. It is an electron hog and can be used to drive 
                              a lot of reactions. We hear about oxygen radicals and oxidative stress in immunology and their potential 
                              for tissue damage. Oxygen plays a key role in many of the cellular processes which sustain life. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Oxygen has 6 electrons in its outer shell. This will make it want to make 2 bonds. The oxygen is a very 
                              reactive element and will be seen in many of the functional groups in organic chemistry like carboxylic 
                              acids,  and hydroxyl groups. The first three elements we covered were all structural in building organic 
                              structures, the oxygen will be the first we deal with that promotes reactions.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Phosphate is the workhorse of biology. It's used as a currency for energy. That makes it one of the most 
                              important elements. Everything the body does is paid for by energy stored by the phosphate group. It also 
                              makes up the backbone of the DNA structure.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The phosphate element has 5 electrons in its outer shell just like nitrogen. The difference is it has an 
                              additional energy shell making it one full shell bigger than nitrogen. Under normal conditions, phosphate 
                              would like to have 3 bonds to be neutral, but phosphate in biology is often not neutral. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The phosphate group is often depicted as a single phosphate bound to 4 oxygens with 1 of them as a double 
                              bond. The 3 single bonded oxygens will be negatively changed which drives reactions. Get to know this 
                              group as it's one of the most common groups in all biology. This phosphate bound to 4 oxygens is how the 
                              body stores energy. Usually it will take 1 to 3 of these phosphate groups and stick them on an amino acid 
                              like Adenine or Guanine. Each one of those bonds between the phosphate groups stores a specific amount of 
                              energy in joules which can activate things in the cells. It's also used to link together the DNA to 
                              create the phosphate backbone. It is slightly negatively charged when it is used in DNA. 
                         </p>

                              Sulfur is another key element in biology. This element is used a lot in building amino acids for 
                              proteins. It is a unique element as it will often bond with itself, creating a disulfide bond. This is 
                              important in building structures in biology with amino acids to build 3 dimensional proteins.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Sulfur has 6 electrons in its outer shell just like oxygen. It just has one extra shell of electrons. It 
                              gets used in some specific amino acids like Cytosine. It often gets used to bond with itself to fold 
                              proteins to build many of the key structures of biology. The structure of the antibody is held together 
                              by multiple disulfide bonds.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="functional">Functional Groups</h2>
                         <p>
                              When dealing with organic chemistry, we are going to go over many of the functional groups of 
                              chemistry and what they do. Some of them will have little application in biology, and we will just 
                              skim over them. Others will be used extensively in biology, and we will go much more in depth with 
                              them. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A hydrocarbon is just a long chain of carbons that is fully saturated with hydrogens on all their 
                              open bonds. If you recall, every carbon wants to make 4 bonds with other elements. When they connect in 
                              long chains, they will fill the open bonds with hydrogens. These are called hydrocarbons. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A hydrocarbon is named by the longest chain of carbons. Let us assume we have a carbon chain that is 8 
                              carbons long.  The longest chain is eight carbons long. It could have some side chains that are made up 
                              of smaller carbon groups, but the longest chain is 8 carbons. They are numbered from 1 to 8. The smaller 
                              groups of carbons are coming off the number 2 and 5 carbons. The type of groups bound to the hydrocarbon 
                              go into its naming. In this example we will say there is a methyl group sticking off the number 2 and 5 
                              carbons. That makes this 2, 5 dimethyl (di meaning 2) octane. Now we will learn how we came up with this 
                              name. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When naming a hydrocarbon, you will come up with a prefix based on the number of carbons in the longest 
                              chain. Then you will come up with a suffix based on the types of bonds in that hydrocarbon.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              <ul>
                              <li>Prefixes:</li>
                              <li>1 carbon = Meth</li>
                              <li>2 carbons = Eth</li>
                              <li>3 carbons = Prop</li>
                              <li>4 carbons = But</li>
                              <li>5 carbons = Pent</li>
                              <li>6 carbons = Hex</li>
                              <li>7 carbons = Hept</li>
                              <li>8 carbons = Oct</li>
                              <li>9 carbons = Non</li>
                              <li>10 carbons = Dec</li>
                              </ul>
                              <ul>
                                   <li>Suffixes:</li>
                                   <li>All Single Bonds = -ane</li>
                                   <li>Double Bond = -ene</li>
                                   <li>Triple Bond = -yne</li>

                              </ul>
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The prefix of the hydrocarbon is named based on the number of carbons in its longest chain. Above is 
                              a list of the prefixes up to 10 carbons. If you have a single carbon filled with hydrogens, it's 
                              methane. The meth comes from the number of carbons with 1 and the ane comes from our suffix because 
                              it has no bonds or only single bonds. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              If we have a 3 carbon chain with all single bonds, it would be propane. The pro comes from the 3 
                              carbons in the chain and the ane comes from the fact it only has single bonds. A hydrocarbon that 
                              has 3 carbons with a double bond would be Propene. A hydrocarbon with 3 carbons in which one is a 
                              triple bond would be Propyne
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Let us try another using a 5 carbon chain. A 5 carbon chain gets the prefix Pent. Then the suffix 
                              comes from the bonds. A 5 carbon chain with all single bonds would be Pentane. A 5 carbon chain with 
                              a double bond on any of them would be Pentene. If it were a 5 carbon chain with at least one triple 
                              bond, it would be called Pentyne.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Hydrocarbons don't have to only be in long chains. They can come in rings. When they appear in a 
                              ring, you add Cyclo to the beginning of the name. If this was a 3 carbon ring with all single bonds, 
                              it would be Cyclopropane. As you can determine from the examples, we have cyclohexene with a six 
                              carbon ring with a double bond in it. This tells us it's a ring hydrocarbon with 6 carbons and at 
                              least 1 double bond. The Cyclooctyne tells us it's a hydrocarbon in a ring with 8 carbons and at 
                              least 1 triple bond. We call these ringed structures Aromatic structures. They are used very 
                              frequently in developing drugs. Many drugs are built off aromatic structures. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last concept is the numbers in hydrocarbons for the functional groups on them. We just learned 
                              how to name the longest chain. What happens when another functional group is sticking off one of the 
                              carbons in the chain? We can use an example of  groups on the number 2 and 4 carbons. That is when 
                              you put in the numbers. You would start with the number for the carbon that has the group then the 
                              type of functional group. In our example, we have an ethyl group (another 2 chain hydrocarbon) 
                              sticking off the number 4 carbon. That becomes 4-ethyl. Then we have a methyl group on the number 2 
                              carbon. That becomes the 2-methyl. Then you just put them all together with the name of the main 
                              chain. It becomes 4-ethyl-2-methyloctane. Notice that when a hydrocarbon becomes a functional group 
                              for another hydrocarbon, its name changes. The Methane becomes Methyl and the Ethane becomes Ethyl. 
                              This is so you know it's a hydrocarbon as a functional group to a bigger compound. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The carbons in the hydrocarbon can make three types of bonds: a single bond, a double bond or a triple 
                              bond. The naming will depend on which types of bonds are used. If every bond in the carbon chain is 
                              single bonds, we call it an Alkane. If it has any double bonds in its chain, it will be called an 
                              Alkene. If it has any triple bonds in its chain, it will be called an Alkyne. Yes, the name of the 
                              hydrocarbon changes its suffix based on the type of bonds. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When dealing with bonds, we should go over one other important concept. A single bond between 2 carbons 
                              is flexible. They can move and rotate. With a double or triple bond, those 2 carbons become fixed. 
                              There is no movement between the two carbons. This is important to understand as many carbon structures 
                              can change shapes, but those double or triple bonds will prevent that by fixing any carbons together 
                              that share those bonds.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This brings up the concept of Cis and Trans. This concept depicts how the functional groups on either 
                              side of a double or triple bond are arranged. Let us assume we have 2 carboxylic groups that are 
                              connected by a double bond. If they are both on the same side, they are considered to be Cis 
                              conformation. If the two groups are on opposite sides on either side of the double bond, they are 
                              considered Trans conformation. This plays a role in Trans Fats which are artificially created fatty 
                              acids.
                         </p>
