                         <p>
                              It is the study of the physical elements. It is about what atoms are made of and how they 
                              become the building blocks of everything on Earth including us. It is about how these 
                              molecules combine, react and change in relationship to each other. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Elements are the basic substances that make up all things. They include things like Carbon, Oxygen, 
                              Gold and Chlorine. All the elements are listed in the Periodic Table of elements. The periodic table 
                              is a very nice diagram that lists all the elements on Earth according to their properties.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The most basic unit of any element is a single atom. If you were to take a chunk of gold and keep 
                              breaking it into pieces until you had the smallest possible piece that still resembles that element, 
                              that would be a single atom of gold. The most common element you will deal with in biology will be 
                              carbon. Everything living on earth is built on a carbon structural backbone. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The number of protons in the atom is what determines what element that atom will be. If it has 6 protons, 
                              it will always be carbon. If it has 8, it will always be oxygen. You can not change the number of 
                              protons in an atom without changing which element it will be. On the periodic table, the number is the 
                              number of protons that element has.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The atom is made up of 3 basic components: the proton, the neutron and the electron. The protons and 
                              neutrons make up the center of the atom called the nucleus. They each weigh about 1 Atomic Mass 
                              Unit (AMU). The electrons orbit around the nucleus and they weigh next to nothing. The protons have 
                              a positive charge, the electrons have a negative charge and the neutrons are neutral. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Each proton and neutron weighs about 1 Atomic Mass Unit (AMU). The electrons have such low weight that 
                              they are not counted for the weight of that element. The atomic weight of any element is the protons plus 
                              the neutrons. Not all elements will have equal amounts of protons and neutrons.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some elements will have more neutrons than others. These are called isotopes. They still have the same 
                              protons so they are the same element, but they have different amounts of neutrons which gives them 
                              different atomic mass. A good example of this is Carbon. Most of the carbon on Earth has 6 protons and 
                              6 neutrons and weighs 12 atomic mass units. There is an isotope of carbon that has 6 protons and 8 
                              neutrons. This is called carbon 14. It weighs 14 atomic mass units.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Most atoms are neutrally charged which means they have the same number of electrons as they have protons, 
                              but many will become ions as they gain or lose electrons through reactions. If an atom has more protons 
                              than electrons, it will become positively charged. If it has more electrons than protons, it will become 
                              negatively charged. A positively charged ion is called a cation. A negatively charged ion is called an 
                              anion. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The electrons orbit the nucleus and they have a negative charge which holds them in orbit as they are 
                              attracted to the positive charge of the protons in the nucleus. The nucleus makes up more than 99% of 
                              the weight, but it's so small that it only takes up a tiny fraction of the atom's space. This is caused 
                              because the electrons of one atom will repel the electrons of another atom. That makes the vast majority 
                              of the atomâ€™s space empty. It's only through reactions can an electron be added, removed or exchanged 
                              with another atom.
                         </p>

                    <section>
                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="electrons">Electron Configurations</h2>
                         <p>
                              In most chemistry books, you see pictures of the electrons in their orbitals that look like planets 
                              orbiting the moon in the solar system. The truth about electrons is they buzz around the nucleus like 
                              flies buzzing around a light bulb at night. The orbitals we use to represent the electrons are more of 
                              a general area in which these electrons will be zipping around. There are 4 types of electron orbitals 
                              with S, P, D and F orbitals. In organic chemistry, the outer shell of the electrons will always have a 
                              max of 8 electrons made up of 1 S and 3 P orbitals. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first  orbital is the S orbital which can only hold 2 electrons. Then will come the 3 P orbitals 
                              which can each hold 2 more electrons each for a total of 6 electrons. There are 2 spots in each of the 
                              P orbitals that can be filled with electrons. You can have 2 in each of the P orbitals which are Px, Py 
                              and Pz. This concept can get complicated very quickly. The key is there are 8 electrons that can appear 
                              in the outermost shell of the atom. They will be made up of 2S and 6P orbital electrons. When you get to 
                              the elements with D and F orbitals, they will always backfill to the inner shells so that only 8 
                              electrons are in the outermost shell. The periodic table is very helpful for you to use as a reference 
                              to figure out where the electrons go. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The periodic table can be a bit intimidating at first, but it becomes a very powerful tool to figure out 
                              electron configurations once you get used to how it works. Electrons have energy shells and orbitals 
                              within each energy shell. There are 7 energy shells starting with the 1 energy shell and going to the 7 
                              energy shell. The lower level energy shells have less orbitals than the higher level energy shells. The 
                              rows of the periodic table represent the energy shell from 1 through 7. The columns represent the 
                              orbitals. There are 4 types of orbitals with the S, P, D and F orbitals. The way to express these energy 
                              shells and orbitals are like 1S or P5. The letter is the orbital and the number is the energy shell. An 
                              element will contain all the energy shells and orbitals of all the elements before it, but it will have 1 
                              extra electron.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The columns are a bit confusing at first in the periodic table as not every row (energy shell) includes all 
                              the possible columns which represent the orbitals from S, P, D and F.  The first P orbital doesnâ€™t start 
                              until the second energy shell 2P. The D orbitals donâ€™t start until the fifth energy shell, but they back 
                              fill the 4D energy shell orbitals. The F orbitals donâ€™t start until the seventh energy shell and also 
                              back fill the 6F energy shell orbitals. When we deal with biology, biochemistry and organic chemistry, 
                              we will deal mostly with the lower energy shells with the S and P orbitals in them. We wonâ€™t deal much 
                              if at all with D or F orbitals.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The lowest energy shell starts with just 1 orbital which is the S orbital. Each orbital contains up to 2 
                              electrons. Every shell will have an S orbital all the way from the 1 energy shell to the 7 energy shell. 
                              The first energy shell row is represented with just 2 elements in Hydrogen and Helium. This 1 energy 
                              shell has only 1 S orbital with 2 electrons in it. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The second row in the periodic table is the 2 energy shell. It includes the 2 electrons from the 1S shell 
                              plus 2 electrons from 2S and up to 6 electrons in the 3 P orbitals of the 2nd energy shell in the second 
                              row of the table. The 2 columns on the far left of the table represent the 2 electrons in the S orbitals 
                              for each energy shell. They contain elements like Lithium, Calcium, Sodium and Potassium. All of these 
                              elements have all their inner energy shells full plus 1 or 2 electrons in their outermost energy shell 
                              in the S orbital.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The 6 columns on the far right represent the 6 electrons in the P orbitals. There are actually 3 P orbitals 
                              called Px, Py and Pz. Each one holds just 2 electrons each. The columns on the far right represent 
                              those 6 electrons for the P orbitals. These elements include things like Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, 
                              Phosphate and Sulfur which are used in biochemistry. All these elements will have all their inner energy 
                              shells filled up to this point in the chart plus they will have some or all of their electrons full in 
                              their P orbitals.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Carbon is a good example. It contains all the electrons of all the elements before it. That means it 
                              has 2 electrons in its 1S energy shell, it has the 2 electrons in its S2 orbital of the 2 energy shell 
                              and it has 2 electrons in the P2 energy shell of the P orbitals. That means it has a total of 6 electrons 
                              with  1S2, 2S2, and 2P2 electrons. This is how we write the electron configuration of any element. We 
                              notate each orbital of each shell in order with 2 electrons in each orbital. You will see each orbital 
                              of P written out like 1S2, 2S2, 2Px2, 2py2 and 2pz2. Most of the time, people will consolidate the P 
                              orbital by just using 2P6. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When you write out the electrons for that element you will write each orbital for each shell and how many 
                              electrons it has. The first number will always be the shell, the second will be the letter for that 
                              specific orbital, and the last number will be the number of electrons occupying that orbital. If we are 
                              writing carbon, we will have 2 electrons in the first shell which is 1S2. Then we will have 2 electrons 
                              in the S orbital of the second shell 2S2. Finally we will have 2 electrons in the P orbital of the second 
                              shell for 2P2. This makes carbon's electron configuration 1S2, 2S2, 2P2. That means carbon has 6 total 
                              electrons which matches its protons for a neutral element. When you write these, you will write the 
                              electrons in an elevated position like an exponent.

                         <p>
                              The term valence electron is used to describe just the electron configuration of the outermost shell 
                              of the atom. When atoms bond or react, it's all going to happen based on the amount of electrons in 
                              the outermost shell. We call them the Valence electrons or Valency for short. Every atom will be 
                              unhappy with less than 8 electrons in that outer shell. Everyone wants a full shell of electrons. 
                              This is what drives chemical bonding. This desire of atoms to exchange electrons so they can all have 
                              8 electrons in that outermost shell. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Based on the number of electrons in the outermost shell, you can quickly figure out what kind of bonds 
                              that element will like to make. Carbon has 4 electrons in the outermost shell. That means it has a 
                              valency of 4. It can gain or lose 4 electrons in bonding to stabilize its outermost shell. The oxygen 
                              has 6 of 8 electrons in its outermost shell. It has a valency of 6. It will often make 2 bonds with 
                              other elements to gain or share those missing 2 electrons. This can be seen in pure oxygen with 2 
                              Oxygen atoms double bonded to each other. They both share 2 electrons with each other. In water, the 
                              oxygen shares 1 electron with 2 of each hydrogen atoms. This is the case in H2O.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When we do the dot structures to represent an atom, we will often use the symbol of the element as the 
                              center. Then we will place 1 dot around that center for each valence electron. With Oxygen it has 6 dots 
                              for its 6 electrons. Any double lines indicate the 2 atoms are sharing a pair of electrons. This allows 
                              each atom of oxygen to have that perfect 8 electrons as it shares 2 of its own for 2 of its neighbors. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When two atoms share electrons in some capacity, we call this bonding. There are two main different kinds 
                              of bonds with Ionic bonds and Covalent bonds. The difference between these two bonds is the level at 
                              which the electrons are shared. We call this electronegativity. Some elements will hog electrons while 
                              others will try to give them away.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Ionic bonds come from the term ions. This is when two atoms of opposite charges bind together. This is 
                              the classic opposites attract. Most ionic bonds happen when an element with few electrons gives them away 
                              to another element that needs just a few more to fill its valence shell. The classic example of an ionic 
                              bond is NaCL or table salt.  Sodium only has 1 electron in its outer shell. It would be really happy to 
                              give it away so it can have a full shell of 1 lower energy level. This makes the sodium positively 
                              charged. It gives that electron to Chlorine which has 7 electrons in its outer shell. It would love 
                              nothing more than to have 1 extra. It takes that electron from the Sodium and becomes negatively charged 
                              with a full octet of electrons in its outer shell. These 2 ions will then bind together in an ionic bond 
                              as the positively charged sodium sticks to the negatively charged chlorine. When placed in water, these 
                              two ions will easily drift apart into their separate ionic elements.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Ionic bonds love to happen between the elements on the left side of the periodic table in the first two 
                              columns where they only have 1 or 2 electrons. They will often donate their electrons to elements in 
                              column 6 or 7 where they need 1 or 2 extra electrons.  
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The second type of bond is called the covalent bond. This is where two atoms bind together and share 
                              electrons equally. The large number of bonds in biochemistry are held together using covalent bonds. 
                              They are strong bonds that require a good deal of energy to break. These are the bonds used to build 
                              many of the chemical structures we deal with from sugar (glucose) to hydrocarbons. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When dealing with covalent bonds, you can quickly know how many bonds an atom will have based on 
                              how many electrons it has in its valence electrons. The carbon atom needs 4 electrons. They can share 
                              2 with each other indicated by a double bond symbol. Then the carbons can share a single electron  each 
                              with 2 hydrogens. When dealing with bonds, you have to learn the concept of electronegativity. The 
                              molecule described here would be Ethene. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Each element will have a different desire to be an electron hog. This desire increases across the 
                              periodic chart from the lower left to the upper right. The elements at the upper right are electron 
                              hogs. When they share electrons with another atom, they hog that electron, causing one atom to become 
                              slightly negatively charged while the other becomes slightly positively charged. This is called a polar 
                              molecule. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              In a polar molecule, one end becomes positively charged and the other end negatively charged. Water is 
                              used as the classic polar molecule. Oxygen is a massive electron hog. It takes the electrons from the 
                              hydrogens causing the hydrogens to become positive while the oxygen has 8 electrons becoming negatively 
                              charged. These polar elements are very common in biochemistry as proteins often fold using electrostatic 
                              charges from these polar elements. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This brings us to the concept of hydrogen bonding. This is used as the concept of water, but it can apply 
                              to other elements. Water is such a polar molecule that one molecule of water will bind to another 
                              molecule of water with the positive hydrogens binding to the negative oxygens and the negative oxygens 
                              binding to the positive hydrogens. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This power of hydrogen bonds is the weakest of bonds, but yet still strong enough to let a bug walk 
                              across the surface of the water. The most important use of hydrogen bonds in biochemistry is the 
                              hydrogen bonds that bind the 2 strands of the DNA together.
