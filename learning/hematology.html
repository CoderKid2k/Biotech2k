                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="hematology">Hematology</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Hematology is the study of the blood, the cells of the blood, the proteins of the blood, the processes 
                              of the blood and even the diseases of the blood. Here we will begin our journey into the study of 
                              hematology and the diseases that occur in the blood. The blood is made up of mostly water. This makes 
                              hydration the key to life and healthy blood. When you have a too little water in the blood it gets think 
                              and causes illness.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When we break down the major 3 components of blood, they will be Plasma which is the watery part, the 
                              Red blood cells and then the Buffy coat. We will look at each of these parts, then we will go back and 
                              look at how they are created. About 55% of the blood is the plasma. This is the watery part of the blood 
                              that the cells move through. This keeps things flowing. There are so many things inside the plasma like 
                              oxygen, carbon dioxide, vitamins, minerals, and proteins. Most of the proteins made for inside the blood 
                              come from the liver. When you talk about a protein in the blood, you can guess it comes form the liver and 
                              90% of the time you will be right. We will cover many of them as we go. Some of these proteins are for 
                              clotting of the blood, When these proteins are not clotted, we call it plasma. When they are allowed to 
                              clot, we call it Serum. These are 2 different terms used for blood and they are important. The serum has 
                              all the clotting factors removed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next major part of the blood is the Red Blood Cells. They carry the oxygen that keeps our cells 
                              alive. That is their sole purpose in life. They are the most important cell in the blood. They make up 
                              about 45% of the blood by volume. We call this number the Hematocrit. This is an important number and 
                              we will dig into it deeper when we get into red blood cells. Many of the diseases of hematology will deal 
                              with defects in Red Blood cells. Red blood cells are not technically cells as they expel their DNA and 
                              nucleus as part of their development. This makes them short lived with one sole purpose in life. We will 
                              spend a lot of time on Red Blood Cells.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Buffy Coat looks white and where it gets its name. Its made up of the many White Blood cells that make 
                              up the immune system. There are about 10 cells that are made in different amounts for the immune system, and 
                              they all fall under the buffy coat. This includes Granulocytes, Myelocytes, T cells, NK cells and B cells. 
                              The buffy coat also includes the platelets which play a role in blood clot formation. All these cells combined 
                              make up about 1% of the blood volume.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The plasma contains the hundreds of proteins that work inside the blood from clotting factors to 
                              transport proteins. They are broken down into 3 classes with alpha, beta and gamma proteins. The Gamma proteins 
                              are the Immunoglobulins also known as the antibodies. The Alpha and Beta proteins include things like 
                              cholesterol proteins among many others. Albumin makes up about 60% of all proteins in the blood. It plays 
                              a key role in regulating osmotic pressure.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All these cells that are in the blood come from a single source called the Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC).
                              It is also known as the Hemocytoblast. The HSC undergoes a process call asymmetric cell replication.
                              When the HSC replicates, it creates one exact copy of itself with a new HSC, and it also creates 1 
                              of 2 possible progenitor cells. It will come out to about 50% of the cells created being a Myeloid 
                              progenitor and about 50% of the time the cells created will be a Lymphoid Progenitor. The Myeloid 
                              progenitor will go on to create Erythrocytes (Red Blood cells), Megakaryocytes (Platelets) along with 
                              Granulocytes and Monocytes for the immune system. The Lymphoid progenitor will create the T cells, B cells 
                              and NK cells.

                         <p> 
                               Iron comes in 2 forms with Ferric Iron (Fe3+) and Ferrous Iron (Fe2+). Which form Iron is in at any point in 
                               the body depends on where it is currently at. We eat iron in both forms. Only the Fe2+ can enter the body 
                               in the small intestines. The stomach will convert Fe3+ into Fe2+ through chemical reactions. The saying you 
                               can use to remember this is, "Fe2 goes INTO the body and INTO the Red Blood cells". The only other source 
                               of iron in the body is recycling of old Red Blood cells my the macrophages in the spleen. The body has no 
                               natural mechanism to remove excess iron. That makes the absorption of iron a very highly regulated process. 
                               This comes into play during iron overload (Hemochromotosis). The only effective way to remove too much iron 
                               from the body is Chelation therapy. This is important in many anemias where the treatment is to give Red Blood 
                               Cells. All these new cells transferred into the patient will eventually get recycled and all that iron ends 
                               up in the body's supply causing iron overload.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Ferrous Iron enters into the Enterocytes of the Duodenum of the GI tract through a transporter called DMT1 
                              (Divalent Metal Transporter 1). This transporter can only accept the Ferrous (Fe2+) iron which we call 
                              Heme Iron as it is the only kind of iron that can be used in Red Blood Cells. For patients who have disease 
                              of the bowl like Celiacs or had bowl surgeries that effect the duodenum of the small bowl, they can have 
                              problems absorbing iron through food sources. They will need supplemental iron usually by muscular 
                              injection or IV. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once the iron is inside the Enterocyte, it can be absorbed into the blood steam if necessary. The 
                              enterocytes turn over frequently. That means any iron that is not needed and absorbed by the body 
                              will be shed with the enterocytes into the waste. The movement of the iron from the enterocyte into the 
                              blood steam requires active transport by the enterocyte through a transport protein called Ferroportin. 
                              This sends the iron into the blood steam in the form of Fe3+ Ferric iron. The iron needs be transported 
                              in the blood by binding to a transport protein called Transferrin. That is because iron is a statically 
                              charged element. It can cause serious damage if not bound to Transferrin. The iron gets stored in the 
                              body in 2 places. The first is it is stored in the Macrophages of the Bone Marrow where it is used to 
                              create Red Blood cells. The main storage of the iron is in the liver. Liver stores of iron are regulated 
                              by a protein called Hepcidin. When the stores in the liver are full, Hepcidin will bind to the ferroportin 
                              receptor on the enterocytes and stop the intake of the iron into the body. When iron stores run low, Hepcidin 
                              will drop and allow iron to pass into the body. When iron gets stored in cells like Macrophages or the 
                              Liver, it gets bound to a protein called Ferritin. The Ferritin storage protein of iron and the Transferrin 
                              transport protein for iron are key diagnostic tools. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When iron is in need, the ferritin will drop as there is no iron to store. The Transferrin will become 
                              elevated in the blood as its looking for any iron it can find. When iron levels are high, the ferritin 
                              will increase in an attempt to store as much of the excess as possible. The transferrin in circulation 
                              will drop as there is no need to find more iron. With this understanding, we can use ferritin and transferrin 
                              levels as diagnostic tools. We refer to them as iron studies.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Ferritin for storing iron is an acute phase reactant. This is because bacteria love and need iron to thrive. 
                              When there is an infection or inflammation, the liver increases the level of ferritin to absorb and hide 
                              all the iron from the bacteria. This becomes important in chronic diseases where there is inflammation. The 
                              body will tend to hide the iron because it thinks it has an infection. There is no defect in the body's 
                              ability to absorb or use the iron. The iron is just being hidden from the body because of the inflammation. 
                              The main issue for iron in the body is iron deficiency. This is the most common anemia in the world. Most 
                              of it is nutritional anemia due to lack of food.

                              Iron Deficiency Anemia do apply in the US mostly around a few key areas. The first in Vegan and Vegetarian 
                              people who don't pay attention to their nutrition as most heme iron comes from meats. Since Iron is so 
                              important to Red Blood cells, iron deficiency anemias will occur where heavy cell creation is being done 
                              like pregnancy and early child development. This is why we use prenatal supplements to give those extra 
                              iron and vitamins. Iron's role in the body will be to create the Hemogobin for the red blood cells. That is because the iron 
                              molecule is charged, and it bind oxygen very well. We will look deeper an Iron Deficiency Anemia later.

                              There is a series of test for the iron in the body called iron studies. They include the level of free 
                              iron in the circulation which is low because it can be harmful. They include the ferritin levels which 
                              can be a sign of iron sequestration due to chronic disease. The final test is the Total Iron Binding 
                              Capacity (TIBC). This measures that amount of the transferrin there is in circulation by measuring the 
                              number of binding capacity. The last number you may see in these studies is the saturation.  Iron saturation 
                              can tell you how much of the total capacity of the Transferrin is actually binding to iron. This is usually 
                              represented as a percentage. This is usually 20% to 50%. High levels could indicate the body is in 
                              need of iron.

                         <p> 
                              The purpose of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) is to pick up, transport and deliver oxygen. They are made up of about 
                              270 million hemoglobin (Hb). Hemoblobin is a complex protein structure we will look at after Red Blood Cells.
                              The RBCs pick up oxygen in the lungs, and they travel through the blood circulation until they reach the 
                              small blood vessels of the tissue where the oxygen will be released. This provides the necessary oxygen 
                              to the tissue cells for survival.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The oxygen levels in the blood are sensed by the Kidneys. When O2 levels are low, the kidneys will release 
                              the growth factor Erythropoietin (EPO). This will travel to the bone marrow and act upon the Hematopoietic 
                              Stem Cells (HSC). This brings us to our first possible disease that leads to anemia. This is anemia of chronic 
                              kidney disease. Since the kidney is critical for regulating RBC development by sensing O2, it can become 
                              dysregulated in disease of the kidney or even in kidney cancers.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Erythropoietin (EPO) will enter the bone marrow and stimulate the HSC to make more Myeloid progenitor 
                              cells. It will also act on the Myeloid progenitor cell to create more Erythroblasts. These are special 
                              cells that make large quantities of Red Blood Cells (RBCs). The body has about 4 to 6 million RBCs per 
                              micro liter of blood that means we have about 25 trillion RBCs at any time with 5 liters of blood in the 
                              average person. We manufacture about 2 million RBCs per second.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The RBC lives about 120 days. When it is first created, it has a biconcave shape. This makes the RBC 
                              very flexible. As the RBC ages, it will become rigid. There is an slit in the spleen where the spleen 
                              macrophages line the blood vessels. Each RBC will have to squeeze through this slit. The older RBCs 
                              become rigid and will not make it through. Then the macrophages will ingest them and break them down.
                              This is a natural process to remove old RBCs and recycle their iron to make new ones. The Spleen macrophages 
                              are capable of removing about 5 million old RBCs per second. All the iron is recycled for use in new RBCs 
                              while the rest becomes waste products like Bilirubin.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The new Red Blood Cells will be created in the Bone Marrow by the Erythroblasts. The early stage of the Red 
                              Blood cell will be a large cell with a nucleus and DNA. They begin to make Hemoglobin. They will pack 
                              about 270 million Hb into every RBC. As the RBC develops it will actually shrink in size. The last thing the 
                              RBC will do before it leaves the bone marrow will be to eject its nucleus and DNA. Then it will be released 
                              into circulation as a Reticulocyte. The Reticulocyte will take a few days to fully mature into a Red Blood 
                              cell.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This brings us to another meaningful clinical test. The Reticulocyte count is about 1% to 3% of the circulating 
                              RBC population. If this number is lower than 1%, you might have a production problem with RBCs. If you have 
                              more than 3% reticulocyte count, then you might have bleeding or a destruction issue. After a few days, the 
                              reticulocytes will become fully mature. They will be about 7 to 8 microns in diameter and take on the 
                              biconcave disc shape.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The RBC retains its shape through structural proteins like spectrin and ankyrin. This brings us to our first 
                              possible defect in the actual RBC. There are mutations in these structural proteins which leads to 
                              misshaped RBCs. This can lead to Spherocytosis and Elliptocytosis. These misshaped RBCs wont pass through 
                              the slit in the spleen. Then will get destroyed by the spleen macrophages. This leads to a destruction 
                              anemia where the RBCs are destroyed as fast as they are made.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Erythropoietin is considered an cytokine and growth factor for Red Blood cells. It binds to the JAK-STAT 
                              pathway receptor. There are genetic mutations in this JAK receptor that will lead to an "always on" effect 
                              like the JAK V617F mutation. This leads to over production diseases like Polycythemia Vera, Essential 
                              Thrombocythemia and Myelofibrosis. These are called Myeloproliferative Disorders. We will look at these 
                              later in Hematology Oncology.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="hemoglobin">Hemoglobin</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Hemoglobin is made up of Heme and Globin. The structure of Hemoglobin is made up a iron (Fe2+), 
                              Protophorphyrin, and a group of 4 proteins called Globins. The Globins are made up from 2 genes called the 
                              Alpha Globin gene and the Beta Globin gene. Two of each of these globin chains will come together to form a 
                              4 leaf clover like structure. Its made from 2 alpha globins and 2 beta globins. At the center of the 4 leaf 
                              clover like Hemoglobin structure is a protien called Protophorphyrin IX. This kind of looks like a snowflake 
                              in its sctructure. It is synthesized from a long pathway of many enzymes that creates the Protophorphyrin protein.
                              In the very center of the Protophorphyrin will bind a molecule of iron. The Iron plus the Protophorphyrin is 
                              the Heme. The 4 globin protiens that make the 4 leaf clover structure are the Globins. Together it forms hemoglobin.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Here comes our first set of diseases in Red Blood Cells. There is a group of disease called Porphyria that stem 
                              from defects in the enzymes which lead to a failure to make the protoporphyrin molecule. The intermediate 
                              steps of protoporphyrin synthesis create intermediates that are toxic. When the next step fails due to a missing enzyme, 
                              the build up of these toxic intermediates occurs. This leads to Phorphyria. There are a few types of this 
                              disorder that attack the nerves and skin.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once the protoporphyrin is formed properly it will bind a single molecule of iron in the center. The only 
                              thing that can go wrong with iron is a lack of it. This is probably one of the largest anemias in the world.
                              The lack of iron leads to Iron Deficiency Anemia and the major causes are malnutrition, pregnancy and child growth.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Globin is made up of 4 actual globin proteins which come together to form a 4 leaf clover like structure. 
                              Now we need to look at these 4 globin proteins as they come in 2 proteins and their are diseases that 
                              stem from them. When the Embryo is in early development, the Red Blood Cells will make Hemoglobin with 2 Zeta 
                              and 2 Epsilon globin proteins. This is called Embryonic Hemoglobin (HbE). As the baby develops into a fetus, 
                              it will begin to produce hemoglobin using 2 Alpha and 2 Gamma globin. This will be called Fetal Hemoglobin 
                              (HbF). After the baby is born, the hemoglobin will start being produced using 2 Alpha and 2 Beta globin proteins.
                              This is called Adult Hemoglobin or HbA. The famous gene BCL11A regulates the transfer from Fetal Hb to 
                              Adult Hb. From the time the baby is born until about 2 years of age, the process of transfer from Fetal to 
                              Adult Hb will take place. There are actually 2 kinds of Adult Hb. The first is the common hemoglobin which 
                              takes 2 alpha and 2 beta globin proteins. This is called HbA1. The other is another adult Hb that is made 
                              up 2 alpha and 2 delta globin proteins. This is called Adult Hb type 2 or HbA2. The blood consists of about 
                              95% to 98% Adult HbA1 and 1% to 3% Adult HbA2. In the average adult Fetal Hb will be made at less than 1%.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first disease from Globin genes comes from the Alpha globin genes. There are 4 genes for these proteins with
                              2 coming from mom and 2 coming from dad. Depending on how many of the 4 genes are lost will determine what 
                              level of Alpha Thalassemia the patient will have. The next disease comes from the Beta Globin genes. There 
                              are only 2 of these genes. You get 1 from mom and 1 from dad. These mutations can vary in the level of Beta 
                              globin that is produced from the full amount to absolutely none. The low production or loss of Beta globin leads 
                              to Beta Thalassemia. Patients with both genes making no beta globin are the most severe form of Beta 
                              Thalassemia. This is often called Beta Thalassemia major.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last disease that orginates from the produciton of Hemoglobin is Sickle Cell Disease. This comes from a 
                              single point mutation in the Beta Globin. This results in a fully functional Beta Globin protein under 
                              most conditions. These mutated forms of Hemoglobin Beta are named Hemoglobin S (HbS) for Sickling. This 
                              single point mutation causes the hemoglobin to bind together into long chains when the oxygen level gets 
                              too low. This polymerization of the HbS causes the Red Blood Cell to take on a Boomerang shape. These sickle 
                              shaped Red Blood Cells can block vessels and cause potentially life threatening blockages. This can lead to 
                              intense pain and even more serious events like a heart attack, pulmonary embolism or stroke. These odd 
                              shaped cells will often get destroyed in the spleen which leads to anemia.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="testing">Lab Tests</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Here we will look at the common values used in checking for anemia. All of them come from the typical 
                              Complete Blood Count (CBC) blood test. Most doctors do one of these annually to ensure all things are 
                              well. The values I give will be a range. These are the typical values on the literature. They may vary 
                              some between different labs. Some labs use different units of measure. I have seen some labs
                               use the standard units here while others use all things adjusted to liters. The ranges will be right, 
                               but you might see 14/dl Hb at one lab and 140/liter at another lab. Just watch the units being used 
                               and adjust.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first series of lab values will be Hematocrit, Hemoglobin and Red Blood Cell counts. When these values 
                              are low, its a sign there might be anemia of some kind. The physical symptoms of anemia are Pale, Tired 
                              and possibly shortness of breath. The Hematocrit measures the level of RBCs as part of the total blood volume. 
                              This tends to be in the 35% and 50% range. Women will tend to be closer to the lower half of the range and 
                              men the upper half. The average is considered 45%. A low hematocrit is called anemia while a high hematocrit 
                              is called polycythemia. This can be caused my altitude or elevation. People who live at high elevations 
                              tend to have higher hematocrit levels. Dehydration can also cause a high hematocrit level. Anemia is a disease 
                              of low Red Blood Cell counts and polycythemia is a disease of high Red Blood Cell counts.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next up is Hemoglobin (Hb). This is a measure of the amount of total Hemoblobin. This will be in the 12.5 
                              to 16 g/dl level. Women tend to be toward the lower end of the range and men near the upper end of the range.
                              Some labs will express this as grams per liter like 125 g/liter to 160 g/liter. Hemoglobin carries the oxygen and 
                              low level will be a sign of anemia. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last one if the Red Blood Cell count. This will be in the range of 4 million to 6 million RBCs per 
                              micro liter of blood. Again women tend to be in the lower range while men will tend to be near the upper 
                              end of the range. I have seen tests where they express this in a exponential format using a per liter 
                              format which will be like 3.5 - 6 * 10E12. These lab values plus any symptoms from the patient would 
                              help point toward anemia, but there are dozens of possible causes for anemia. It can be blood loss, 
                              autoimmune, genetic defect or even hemolytic. It will require more labs.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next set of values will be the Mean Corpuscular Value (MCV). This is the measure of the average size 
                              of the Red Blood cells. This comes in a standard range of 80 to 100 fl. If the value is in the normal range, 
                              it can indicate one of the normocytic anemias. Anything below 80 fl will be considered a microcytic anemia 
                              and anything over 100 fl will be considered a macrocytic anemia. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next important count is the Reticulocyte count. This measures the amount of immature red blood cells 
                              in circulation. The reticulocytes should range between 1% and 3%. If this is below 1%, it can be a sign of 
                              an underproduction anemia. With underproduction anemia, something is wrong or missing which leads to blast cells not 
                              developing enough RBCs. There is just not enough RBCs able to be made. When the reticulocyte count is over 3%,
                              then it could point to a destruction anemia or blood loss. This means the blood is making tons of new red blood 
                              cells trying to make up for the loss. This is where the next set of lab test can come in. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next 3 tests are called the tests of Hemolysis. They measure if Red Blood cells are being destroyed or 
                              broken down. This is a key set of labs if the concern is a destruction anemia vs something like blood loss 
                              due to a GI bleed. The first is
                              Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) which is an enzyme used in cell metabolism. When the LDH level is high, its a sign of 
                              high cell turn over suggesting cell destruction. The next is Unconjugated Bilirubin which is an molecule 
                              that is created through cell break down. High levels of unconjugated bilirubin is a sign that cells are 
                              being destroyed. The last one is Haptaglobin. We already know that iron when left in the blood without a 
                              transport protein can cause big damage. Haptaglobin is a protein in the blood that is there to absorb any 
                              iron released due to cell destruction. When red blood cells are destroyed in the blood vessels the 
                              haptoglobin level will drop. This is another sign of red cell destruction.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              These series of test will help inform the doctor about whether or not anemia exist and what type of 
                              anemia is present. There is also a set of iron studies that report on serum iron, TIBC and Ferritin. 
                              These can be used if you think that the problem might be iron related.
