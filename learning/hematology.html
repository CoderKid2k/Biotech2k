                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="hematology">Hematology</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Hematology is the study of the blood, the cells of the blood, the proteins of the blood, the processes 
                              of the blood and even the diseases of the blood. Here we will begin our journey into the study of 
                              hematology and the diseases that occur in the blood. The blood is made up of mostly water. This makes 
                              hydration the key to life and healthy blood. When you have a too little water in the blood it gets think 
                              and causes illness.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When we break down the major 3 components of blood, they will be Plasma which is the watery part, the 
                              Red blood cells and then the Buffy coat. We will look at each of these parts, then we will go back and 
                              look at how they are created. About 55% of the blood is the plasma. This is the watery part of the blood 
                              that the cells move through. This keeps things flowing. There are so many things inside the plasma like 
                              oxygen, carbon dioxide, vitamins, minerals, and proteins. Most of the proteins made for inside the blood 
                              come from the liver. When you talk about a protein in the blood, you can guess it comes form the liver and 
                              90% of the time you will be right. We will cover many of them as we go. Some of these proteins are for 
                              clotting of the blood, When these proteins are not clotted, we call it plasma. When they are allowed to 
                              clot, we call it Serum. These are 2 different terms used for blood and they are important. The serum has 
                              all the clotting factors removed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next major part of the blood is the Red Blood Cells. They carry the oxygen that keeps our cells 
                              alive. That is their sole purpose in life. They are the most important cell in the blood. They make up 
                              about 45% of the blood by volume. We call this number the Hematocrit. This is an important number and 
                              we will dig into it deeper when we get into red blood cells. Many of the diseases of hematology will deal 
                              with defects in Red Blood cells. Red blood cells are not technically cells as they expel their DNA and 
                              nucleus as part of their development. This makes them short lived with one sole purpose in life. We will 
                              spend a lot of time on Red Blood Cells.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Buffy Coat looks white and where it gets its name. Its made up of the many White Blood cells that make 
                              up the immune system. There are about 10 cells that are made in different amounts for the immune system, and 
                              they all fall under the buffy coat. This includes Granulocytes, Myelocytes, T cells, NK cells and B cells. 
                              The buffy coat also includes the platelets which play a role in blood clot formation. All these cells combined 
                              make up about 1% of the blood volume.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The plasma contains the hundreds of proteins that work inside the blood from clotting factors to 
                              transport proteins. They are broken down into 3 classes with alpha, beta and gamma proteins. The Gamma proteins 
                              are the Immunoglobulins also known as the antibodies. The Alpha and Beta proteins include things like 
                              cholesterol proteins among many others. Albumin makes up about 60% of all proteins in the blood. It plays 
                              a key role in regulating osmotic pressure.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All these cells that are in the blood come from a single source called the Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC).
                              It is also known as the Hemocytoblast. The HSC undergoes a process call asymmetric cell replication.
                              When the HSC replicates, it creates one exact copy of itself with a new HSC, and it also creates 1 
                              of 2 possible progenitor cells. It will come out to about 50% of the cells created being a Myeloid 
                              progenitor and about 50% of the time the cells created will be a Lymphoid Progenitor. The Myeloid 
                              progenitor will go on to create Erythrocytes (Red Blood cells), Megakaryocytes (Platelets) along with 
                              Granulocytes and Monocytes for the immune system. The Lymphoid progenitor will create the T cells, B cells 
                              and NK cells.
