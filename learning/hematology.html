                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="hematology">Hematology</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Hematology is the study of the blood, the cells of the blood, the proteins of the blood, the processes 
                              of the blood and even the diseases of the blood. Here we will begin our journey into the study of 
                              hematology and the diseases that occur in the blood. The blood is made up of mostly water. This makes 
                              hydration the key to life and healthy blood. When you have a too little water in the blood it gets think 
                              and causes illness.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When we break down the major 3 components of blood, they will be Plasma which is the watery part, the 
                              Red blood cells and then the Buffy coat. We will look at each of these parts, then we will go back and 
                              look at how they are created. About 55% of the blood is the plasma. This is the watery part of the blood 
                              that the cells move through. This keeps things flowing. There are so many things inside the plasma like 
                              oxygen, carbon dioxide, vitamins, minerals, and proteins. Most of the proteins made for inside the blood 
                              come from the liver. When you talk about a protein in the blood, you can guess it comes form the liver and 
                              90% of the time you will be right. We will cover many of them as we go. Some of these proteins are for 
                              clotting of the blood, When these proteins are not clotted, we call it plasma. When they are allowed to 
                              clot, we call it Serum. These are 2 different terms used for blood and they are important. The serum has 
                              all the clotting factors removed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next major part of the blood is the Red Blood Cells. They carry the oxygen that keeps our cells 
                              alive. That is their sole purpose in life. They are the most important cell in the blood. They make up 
                              about 45% of the blood by volume. We call this number the Hematocrit. This is an important number and 
                              we will dig into it deeper when we get into red blood cells. Many of the diseases of hematology will deal 
                              with defects in Red Blood cells. Red blood cells are not technically cells as they expel their DNA and 
                              nucleus as part of their development. This makes them short lived with one sole purpose in life. We will 
                              spend a lot of time on Red Blood Cells.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Buffy Coat looks white and where it gets its name. Its made up of the many White Blood cells that make 
                              up the immune system. There are about 10 cells that are made in different amounts for the immune system, and 
                              they all fall under the buffy coat. This includes Granulocytes, Myelocytes, T cells, NK cells and B cells. 
                              The buffy coat also includes the platelets which play a role in blood clot formation. All these cells combined 
                              make up about 1% of the blood volume.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The plasma contains the hundreds of proteins that work inside the blood from clotting factors to 
                              transport proteins. They are broken down into 3 classes with alpha, beta and gamma proteins. The Gamma proteins 
                              are the Immunoglobulins also known as the antibodies. The Alpha and Beta proteins include things like 
                              cholesterol proteins among many others. Albumin makes up about 60% of all proteins in the blood. It plays 
                              a key role in regulating osmotic pressure.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All these cells that are in the blood come from a single source called the Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC).
                              It is also known as the Hemocytoblast. The HSC undergoes a process call asymmetric cell replication.
                              When the HSC replicates, it creates one exact copy of itself with a new HSC, and it also creates 1 
                              of 2 possible progenitor cells. It will come out to about 50% of the cells created being a Myeloid 
                              progenitor and about 50% of the time the cells created will be a Lymphoid Progenitor. The Myeloid 
                              progenitor will go on to create Erythrocytes (Red Blood cells), Megakaryocytes (Platelets) along with 
                              Granulocytes and Monocytes for the immune system. The Lymphoid progenitor will create the T cells, B cells 
                              and NK cells.

                         <p> 
                               Iron comes in 2 forms with Ferric Iron (Fe3+) and Ferrous Iron (Fe2+). Which form Iron is in at any point in 
                               the body depends on where it is currently at. We eat iron in both forms. Only the Fe2+ can enter the body 
                               in the small intestines. The stomach will convert Fe3+ into Fe2+ through chemical reactions. The saying you 
                               can use to remember this is, "Fe2 goes INTO the body and INTO the Red Blood cells". The only other source 
                               of iron in the body is recycling of old Red Blood cells my the macrophages in the spleen. The body has no 
                               natural mechanism to remove excess iron. That makes the absorption of iron a very highly regulated process. 
                               This comes into play during iron overload (Hemochromotosis). The only effective way to remove too much iron 
                               from the body is Chelation therapy. This is important in many anemias where the treatment is to give Red Blood 
                               Cells. All these new cells transferred into the patient will eventually get recycled and all that iron ends 
                               up in the body's supply causing iron overload.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Ferrous Iron enters into the Enterocytes of the Duodenum of the GI tract through a transporter called DMT1 
                              (Divalent Metal Transporter 1). This transporter can only accept the Ferrous (Fe2+) iron which we call 
                              Heme Iron as it is the only kind of iron that can be used in Red Blood Cells. For patients who have disease 
                              of the bowl like Celiacs or had bowl surgeries that effect the duodenum of the small bowl, they can have 
                              problems absorbing iron through food sources. They will need supplemental iron usually by muscular 
                              injection or IV. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once the iron is inside the Enterocyte, it can be absorbed into the blood steam if necessary. The 
                              enterocytes turn over frequently. That means any iron that is not needed and absorbed by the body 
                              will be shed with the enterocytes into the waste. The movement of the iron from the enterocyte into the 
                              blood steam requires active transport by the enterocyte through a transport protein called Ferroportin. 
                              This sends the iron into the blood steam in the form of Fe3+ Ferric iron. The iron needs be transported 
                              in the blood by binding to a transport protein called Transferrin. That is because iron is a statically 
                              charged element. It can cause serious damage if not bound to Transferrin. The iron gets stored in the 
                              body in 2 places. The first is it is stored in the Macrophages of the Bone Marrow where it is used to 
                              create Red Blood cells. The main storage of the iron is in the liver. Liver stores of iron are regulated 
                              by a protein called Hepcidin. When the stores in the liver are full, Hepcidin will bind to the ferroportin 
                              receptor on the enterocytes and stop the intake of the iron into the body. When iron stores run low, Hepcidin 
                              will drop and allow iron to pass into the body. When iron gets stored in cells like Macrophages or the 
                              Liver, it gets bound to a protein called Ferritin. The Ferritin storage protein of iron and the Transferrin 
                              transport protein for iron are key diagnostic tools. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When iron is in need, the ferritin will drop as there is no iron to store. The Transferrin will become 
                              elevated in the blood as its looking for any iron it can find. When iron levels are high, the ferritin 
                              will increase in an attempt to store as much of the excess as possible. The transferrin in circulation 
                              will drop as there is no need to find more iron. With this understanding, we can use ferritin and transferrin 
                              levels as diagnostic tools. We refer to them as iron studies.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Ferritin for storing iron is an acute phase reactant. This is because bacteria love and need iron to thrive. 
                              When there is an infection or inflammation, the liver increases the level of ferritin to absorb and hide 
                              all the iron from the bacteria. This becomes important in chronic diseases where there is inflammation. The 
                              body will tend to hide the iron because it thinks it has an infection. There is no defect in the body's 
                              ability to absorb or use the iron. The iron is just being hidden from the body because of the inflammation. 
                              The main issue for iron in the body is iron deficiency. This is the most common anemia in the world. Most 
                              of it is nutritional anemia due to lack of food.

                              Iron Deficiency Anemia do apply in the US mostly around a few key areas. The first in Vegan and Vegetarian 
                              people who don't pay attention to their nutrition as most heme iron comes from meats. Since Iron is so 
                              important to Red Blood cells, iron deficiency anemias will occur where heavy cell creation is being done 
                              like pregnancy and early child development. This is why we use prenatal supplements to give those extra 
                              iron and vitamins. Iron's role in the body will be to create the Hemogobin for the red blood cells. That is because the iron 
                              molecule is charged, and it bind oxygen very well. We will look deeper an Iron Deficiency Anemia later.

                              There is a series of test for the iron in the body called iron studies. They include the level of free 
                              iron in the circulation which is low because it can be harmful. They include the ferritin levels which 
                              can be a sign of iron sequestration due to chronic disease. The final test is the Total Iron Binding 
                              Capacity (TIBC). This measures that amount of the transferrin there is in circulation by measuring the 
                              number of binding capacity. The last number you may see in these studies is the saturation.  Iron saturation 
                              can tell you how much of the total capacity of the Transferrin is actually binding to iron. This is usually 
                              represented as a percentage. This is usually 20% to 50%. High levels could indicate the body is in 
                              need of iron.
