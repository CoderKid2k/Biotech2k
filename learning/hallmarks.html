                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="hallmarks">The Hallmarks of Cancer</h2>
                         <p>     
                              In 2000, the first hallmarks of cancer were published. There were 6 behaviors all cancers would 
                              develop as they go from healthy cells to metastatic growth. This was the first attempt to organize the 
                              complexity of cancer biology. Since then, we have added four more. Cancer begins when a cell loses 
                              control over the functions that regulate cell growth. It begins with genetic instability, loss of 
                              mortality, uncontrolled growth and loss of growth inhibitors. These are the main genetic drivers 
                              of cancer. Then it proceeds to immune invasion by learning to escape immune detection and promoting 
                              an environment of tolerance. There are a few other hallmarks of cancer that transition into invasion, 
                              angiogenesis, and metastasis.
                         </p>
                         <p id="hallmark1">
                              Hallmark 1: Sustained Proliferative Signaling
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first hallmark of cancer is sustained growth signaling. Under normal circumstances, 
                              the cells of the body do not replicate unless it is necessary. Some cells will normally 
                              replicate frequently and others will never replicate. Cancer begins when a cell begins 
                              to act on its own replicating without the necessary signaling. This can happen when a mutation  occurs 
                              in one of the growth pathways. These are those proto-oncogenes that mutate to become oncogenes which 
                              drives cell proliferation. They are mutations in the growth receptors for growth signals like EGFR, VEGF, 
                              FGFR and PDGF and many more. These types of mutations will lead to an always on state for those growth 
                              factor receptors. This is called becoming Constitutively Active.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some of these increased growth signals come from the duplication of a gene during DNA synthesis. This 
                              leads to multiple copies of a growth receptor. This leads to hyperactivity of the cell from an over 
                              expression of growth receptors. These are called amplification mutations. Some of these proto-oncogene 
                              mutations occur in the internal cellular growth pathways like RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK, PI3K and AKT. These 
                              pathways link the growth receptors to the genes in the cell that control growth. It only takes one 
                              mutation in one of these oncogenes to drive increased cell growth. These cells can be perfectly normal in 
                              every way except they are replicating at a faster rate. Mutations in proto-oncogenes lead to gain of 
                              function mutations.

                         <p id="hallmark2">
                              Hallmark 2: Evading Growth Suppressors
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The second hallmark of cancer is the loss of those genes that prevent cells from growing without the 
                              proper signals. They involve proteins that verify the DNA during the cell cycle checkpoints like p53, 
                              p21 and Rb. These genes regulate the cell cycle by blocking growth under normal conditions 
                              are called Tumor Suppressor genes. They act like the brakes for the cell growth cycle. Mutations in the
                              Tumor Suppressor genes cause a loss of function. They include the DNA Damage Repair (DDR) pathway proteins 
                              and enzymes that fix damage to the DNA. DNA damage repair pathways fix damage from stress like oxidation, 
                              radiation and chemicals. These tumor suppressor genes are broken down into gatekeeper genes and caretaker 
                              genes. The gatekeepers are those genes that act as the breaks to cell replication. They are there to 
                              prevent it from occurring unless the proper signals have been given. The caretaker genes are there to 
                              ensure the integrity and control DNA repair.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Since there are 2 copies of every Tumor Suppressor gene, they will still work if only 1 gene is lost. This 
                              leads us to the 2 hit hypothesis of tumor suppressor genes. This states that both genes must be lost before 
                              the function of a tumor suppressor gene is completely lost. 
                         </p>

                              Hallmark 3: Genomic Instability
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This hallmark is considered one of the first mutations to occur. Genetic Instability  makes the cell 
                              unstable and allows for the rapid and progressive mutations from one generation to the next. This occurs 
                              when the cell loses the ability to quality check its DNA when it replicates like the p53 protein or DNA 
                              repair proteins. We said that a cell makes about one mistake in copying the DNA each time it replicates 
                              the DNA. Most of them are caught and corrected. Genetic Instability occurs when something mutates to 
                              stop this quality check or the DNA Damage Repair pathways.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some of the genetic instability leads to errors in the actual chromosomes like gene deletions, duplications 
                              and translocations. These are called gene rearrangements and they alter the DNA. Many of these errors are 
                              common to specific types of cancer.  One such example is the Philadelphia Chromosome. It's a translocation 
                              between Chromosome 9 and 22. A portion of each chromosome is cut and placed on the opposite chromosome.
                              One such concept is called chromothripsis where the chromosomes gain many of these rearrangement 
                              mutations This becomes like the scrambling of the chromosome with many mutations.

                              Hallmark 4: Resist Death Signals
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next hallmark is the shifting of the balance between the signals that tell a cell to survive over 
                              those that tell it to die. All cells are constantly getting feedback in the form of signals that tell them 
                              when they should survive and when they should die. You want a healthy cell to survive and bad cells to 
                              die. Only when something goes wrong, should it initiate programmed cell death (Apoptosis). In cancer, the 
                              pathways for the survival signals will mutate and greatly shift that balance in favor of survival even in 
                              conditions where a cell should undergo death like DNA damage. 
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              Telomeres are the caps on the end of each chromosome. Think of them like the little caps on the end of your 
                              shoe strings. They have a specific length. Each time a cell replicates, the telomere gets slightly shorter.
                              After several generations of replication, you can exhaust the telomere. After the telomere runs out, the 
                              cell can no longer replicate. This is called the Hayflick limit. It is called Senescence when the cell 
                              reaches its limitations to replication. The stem cells are immortal as they have a gene active for them to 
                              extend their telomeres each time they replicate. Cancer cells mutate to turn on the telomerase enzyme which 
                              extends the telomeres after each replication giving them attributes of stem cells. This gives them immortality.

                              Cancer cells will mutate their ability to take up glucose to power their rapid replication. It is shown that 
                              Cancer cells will uptake glucose at 100x the rate of normal cells. Since the tumor usually forms in the tissue 
                              where there is no or little oxygen, cancer cells will often rewire their metabolism to make them anaerobic. 
                              The cellular respiration cycle has several processes of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and the Electron 
                              Transport Chain. The later two use oxygen to break down glucose and make ATP which the cell uses for energy. The 
                              process of Glycolysis does not require oxygen which allows cancer cells to use this part of the process to 
                              produce energy for survival in a low oxygen environment of the tissue.
                              This takes the glucose and breaks it down into Lactic Acid instead of Pyruvate which gets used in the rest of 
                              the process. This leaves the tumor microenvironment very acidic.

                              The next hallmark of cancer is the creation of new blood vessels. This is also the first step toward 
                              metastasis. The blood vessels provide a connection for the tumor to the circulation and the rest of the 
                              body.  Tumors need a lot of nutrients to drive their growth. They will release Vascular Endothelial Growth 
                              Factor (VEGF) which will act on the endothelial cells of nearby blood vessels. This will cause them to 
                              create new routes of blood vessels toward those signals. Angiogenesis of new vessels act as a boost
                              for the tumor. It provides key nutrients to the tumor to promote growth, and it acts as a 
                              highway system for tumor cells to move into the circulation and travel to other tissues.

                              The tumor will hijack the inflammation process and use it to promote its own growth. The tumor promotes 
                              NF-kappa signaling of immune cells which release inflammatory signals to recruit immune cells to the tumor 
                              microenvironment. The tumor will release signals to recruit neutrophils which can degranulate and damage 
                              nearby healthy cells, clearing the way for the tumor to expand and grow. The helper T cells and macrophages
                              in the area can also release growth signals which help drive the growth of tumor cells. The tumor not only 
                              learns to avoid the immune system, but it uses the immune system to do its bidding.

                              Hallmark 9: Avoiding Immune Destruction
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Tumor cells must learn to evade immune destruction. The immune system is designed to find and kill mutated 
                              cells. The tumor can develop many mechanisms by which it will block the immune response. The first is that 
                              the tumor will promote the creation of T regulatory cells. It does this by secreting cytokines like IL-10 
                              and TGF-beta. This will cause T helper cells to switch into induced T regs. They will then release cytokines 
                              which will shut down the immune response toward the tumor. The macrophages in the area will be switched 
                              away from the M1 phenotype which kills tumor cells and to the M2 phenotype so they release TGF-beta which 
                              promotes growth for the tumor and inducement of T regulatory cells. The tumor cells can express ligands on 
                              their surface that can deactivate cytotoxic T cells and Macrophages. They can express PD-L1 which will 
                              stop cytotoxic T cells from killing them. The constant activation of these T cells without the ability to 
                              kill leads to them becoming exhausted, causing them to fail to respond at all. The tumor cells can also 
                              express CD47 which will prevent any M1 macrophages from killing them.

                              Hallmark 10: Invasion and Metastasis
                         </p>     
                         <p>
                              The last Hallmark for cancer is the ability to invade nearby tissue and travel to distant tissues 
                              and set up secondary tumors. Normally, cells are anchored to where they belong by cell adhesion 
                              molecules. They hold the cell in place. A mutation in these cellular adhesion molecules will allow 
                              the cells to break free from their normal tissue and invade nearby tissue. If there are blood vessels 
                              nearby, they can also travel through the blood to distant sites and spread. This process is called 
                              metastasizing. The statistics show that 90% of cancers become fatal once they are metastatic. During 
                              the process of metastasis, the cells must undergo a transition from a normal Epithelial cell into a 
                              Mesenchymal type stem cell. This process is called the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). 
                              The Mesenchymal cell is a stem cell-like population. These invasive EMT cells will intravasate into 
                              the blood vessels where they become circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The circulation is very hostile to 
                              these CTC cells, but survivors can extravasate into new tissues called homing.
                         </p>    
                         <p>
                              Certain cancers like to home to specific tissues when it comes to creating metastasis called Mets. This 
                              brings us to the seed and soil hypothesis. This states the CTC cells are like seeds that spread out from 
                              the tumor. They will spread everywhere, but they will only be able to take root in congenial soil that 
                              will support new growth. Some of these EMT cells can lay dormant for decades at new sites before they 
                              start to grow a new metastasis. Each cancer type will have specific tissues where it tends to spread 
                              like prostate cancer nearly always goes to the bone. The most common place metastases appear are Brain, 
                              Bone, Liver and Lungs.
