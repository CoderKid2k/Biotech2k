                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="introtcells">Intro to T Cells</h2>
                         <p>     
                              Before I get into T cells, there is one important concept in biology and immunology that must be 
                              understood so that T cells will make sense. A lot of things will make sense after this. It is 
                              the concept of Cellular Adhesion Molecules. What are they? They are proteins on the surface of cells 
                              that allow them to bind and interact with other cells. Did you ever wonder why a liver cell stays in 
                              the liver and a heart cell knows to stay in the heart? This is Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are 3 families of CAMs we will want to understand with the cadherins, the selectins and the 
                              integrins. The first is Cadherins which bind cells together and to the Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM is
                              a web of proteins which cells bind to). Cadherins hold cells in place so they don't move. They bind 
                              to each other or the ECM. This is important in cancer as loss of these Cadherins allow cells to 
                              Metastasize. It also provides contact inhibition so cells don't undergo mitosis unless it is necessary 
                              like a cell is destroyed by injured. The only cells in the body that move around are the blood and immune 
                              cells.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This brings us to the first key concept of T cells with Trafficking. When a tissue expresses the right 
                              CAMs for the T cells, they will be able to grab ahold by using their Selectins and Integrins like 
                              L-Selectin. This allows them to move out of the blood flow and into the tissue where the selectins are being 
                              expressed. When T cells are inactive, they tend to only express selectins and integrins that allow them to 
                              travel from Lymph node to circulation and back to other lymph nodes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              They tend to patrol the circulation and lymph systems. That is their job to look for any Antigen Presenting 
                              Cell (APC) that might have some pathogen to activate them.  When inflammation occurs, there are cytokines that 
                              activate the selectins and integrins on the T cells. They get secreted into the tissue and blood that 
                              surround area of inflammation. This causes a change in those endothelial cells and the T cells. These inflammatory 
                              cytokines like IL8 will cause the selectins and integrins on both the T cell and Endothelial cell to 
                              change. Now the T cell can bind to the Endothelial cell and get pulled through into the tissue where it is needed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This concept of trafficking is an active process in immunology. Its doesn't happen on its own. It 
                              requires inflammation and proper signaling to cause the change in expression of Selectins and 
                              Integrins on these cells. It also applies to other things like Vectors to deliver genetic therapies. 
                              A vector like Lipid Nano Particles (LNP) can not traffic because they don't express the selectins 
                              or integrins to get out of the blood stream. Some things are small enough to diffuse across the blood 
                              vessels into the tissue in the capillaries where vessels are leaky. This happens with Complement proteins, 
                              Antibodies and Viruses that are so small they just pass trough with the Osmotic pressure. Understanding, how
                              T cell traffick into tissues is a critical concept for both immunology and oncology.

                         <p> 
                              The Stem cells in the bone marrow produce all the cells of the circulation including the White Blood cells. 
                              There are about 10 immune cells that come from these Stem cells. We are only going to focus on the T cell 
                              here. The stem cells can give rise to 2 progeny in the Myeloid Progenitor and the Lymphoid progenitor. This 
                              happens by the stem cell doing replication which creates 1 new stem cells and 1 new cell of the myeloid or 
                              lymphoid progenitor. This is called asynchronous replication. The T cells come from the Lymphoid progenitor cells. 
                         </p>   
                         <p>
                              The precursor to the adult T cell forms in the Bone Marrow. It will only have on cellular adhesion 
                              molecules on it that will allow it to go to the Thymus. It will be released from the bone marrow 
                              where it will travel the circulation until it reaches the Thymus and its cell adhesion molecules will bind 
                              and allow it to enter the Thymus. When it enters the thymus, it will be known as a Double Negative T 
                              cell (DN). It will now be called a Thymocyte.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This new Thymocyte will undergo multiple stages of development in the thymus. The first is 
                              called the Double Negative stage (DN). It has 4 stages of this DN phase it goes through. It has 
                              to develop its T cell receptor (TCR) during this stage. Here the new Thymocyte will attempt to use the
                               genes for the Alpha and Beta T cell receptor first. If it is successful, it moves on. If not, it will 
                               attempt to use the Delta and Gamma genes. It does this by first tyring to do recombination with the Beta 
                               chain genes. If it gets a successful Beta chain arrangemnet, it will move onto the alpha chain. It can only 
                               do this with one of the 2 chromosome alleles. This is called allelic exlusion. This ensures each and every 
                               T cell has only 1 receptor and every receptor is the exact same on that T cell. About 95% of the Thymocytes 
                               will become Alpha/Beta T cells. The other 5% will become Delta/Gamma T cells and leave the Thymus immediately.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once the T cell receptor is formed it will be displayed on the cell surface along with other parts of the T 
                              cell receptor Complex. This includes multiple CD3 proteins and the Zeta chain proteins. It will have multiple 
                              CD3 chains with Gamma, Epsilon, and Delta chains of the CD3. It will also include 2 zeta chains. All the these 
                              CD3 and Zeta chains have intracellular domains that have these domains which become activated during the T cell receptor 
                              complex activation. These are called Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs or ITAMS. These are critical 
                              to the T cell activation once the TCR enganges antigen.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A this point the T cell will have a successful receptor. It will also produce and display both co-receptors 
                              with CD4 and CD8. This is the only time in the T cell's life it will have both. At this point the T cell is 
                              called a double positive T cell as it is positive for both of these co-receptors. So now we went from Double 
                              Negative Thymocytes to Double Positive T cells. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next stage of development will be the process of Positive Selection. Each and every T cell will test its 
                              receptor with the MHC I and MHC II proteins being expressed by the cells of the thymus. Those that react too 
                              strongly are killed off as they would be self reactive. Those that bind well to MHC I will stop producing CD4 
                              and go on to just epxress CD8 co-receptor. They will be called CD8+ T cells now. Those that respond well to 
                              the MHC II will stop producing CD8 and only express CD4. They will be called CD4+ T cells. This is the process 
                              by which the T cells figure out their role in the immune response by being sorted into helper and cytotoxic T cells
                              according to which MHC they work best with.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The final stage of selection is called Negative Selection. During this stage of training, the T cells will 
                              test their receptors against self protein antigens. There is a set of cells in the thymus which have special 
                              genes that allow them to express a huge range of self proteins like the T cells will encounter in the circulation.
                              Each T cell will test its receptor toward these proteins. If they react to them strongly, they will be killed off.
                              Some of them that react modestly to a self antigen will get signals to become T regulatory cells. These T regs will 
                              enter the circulation and prevent other T cells from reacting to the protein that matches their receptor. They become 
                              the police of the immune system. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Once the T cells pass Negative Selection, they will be release into the circulation where can begin to travel 
                              from lymph node to lymph node patrolling for antigens that match their receptors. The process of T cell training 
                              inside the thymus is so extensive that only 5% or so of T cells survive the process. That means 95% of them don't.
                              This process gives the T cells centeral tolerance for self antigens.
                              In the ciruclation they will be naive T cells which have not encountered antigens yet. Once they encounter their antigen 
                              they will mature into effector T cells. 
                         </p>

                              Inside the Thymus, there is the Medullary region. This is where negative selection occurs. The cells there 
                              are called Medullary Thymic Epithelial Cells (mTEC). They have this special transcription factor called 
                              AIRE. This stands for Auto Immune Transcription Element (AIRE). If you ever looked into genetics, each 
                              cell only has active genes it needs for its role. The heart cell only has genes active it needs to be a 
                              heart cell. The liver cell only has genes active for its role as a liver cell. The AIRE transcription factor turns 
                              on all genes in these mTEC cells. This allows them to display a host of proteins that are self. This plays 
                              a critical role in the negative selection process.

                              All the thymocytes will test their T cell receptor against these self antigens. Those that have a high affinity 
                              toward that self antigen will get the signal to undergo cell death. Those that have low affinity will get 
                              passed into the circulation. The rare few that have an intermediate reaction can be converted into T regulatory
                              cells (T regs). They can get the signals that induce that transition from naive T cell into regulatory T 
                              cell. Their job will be to protect the body should any reactive T cells escape the negative selection 
                              process. There is a set of genetic diseases that stem from defects in the AIRE gene. This leads to massive 
                              multi organ auto immune disorders. In patients who have a genetic defect in the AIRE gene, they don't produce 
                              AIRE, or they produce a form of it that is not functional. This leads to no self proteins being presented 
                              by the mTEC cells. That means all T cells will be passed through negative selection.

                              You might be wondering how the T cells don't kill all those friendly bacteria and viruses that live in 
                              and on us. They don't get checked in the thymus as part of the negative selection process. This is where 
                              peripheral tolerance comes in.  A T cell needs to have multiple signals to confirm its activation. The biding 
                              of its receptor to a matching antigen is only one of them. It requires cytokines and other receptors to be 
                              activated to turn the T cell on. Without these confirming 2nd and 3rd signals, the T cell will most like fall 
                              into angery which means it does nothing. Eventually it will dies from neglect. If the T cell binds to an 
                              antigen, but then gets other signals like TGF-Beta, it can be induced into a T regulatory cell. That new T reg 
                              cell will then stop repsonses by other T cells to that antigen. This is the process of peripheral tolerance. It gets exploited 
                              by cancer to induce T reg cells that promote tolerance to the tumor.
                         </p>

                              When a T cell is removed by death either in the thymus by negative selection or in the circulation, this is 
                              called clonal deletion. That specific genetic combination of genes that created that T cell receptor will 
                              be deleted along with the T cell.
