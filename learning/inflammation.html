                         <p>     
                              Inflammation is the bodies alarm for damage or infections. It can start from tissue damage like a 
                              cut or broken bone. It can also start with an infection that gets into the tissue. There are four 
                              cardinal symptoms of inflammation with Pain, Redness, Heat and Swelling. The Endothelial cells that 
                              make up the blood vessels regulate what can move out of the blood and into the tissue. The endothelial 
                              cells are very active cells with many functions from regulating the blood as a liquid in healthy conditions 
                              to initiating clotting in injury. They also play a key role in inflammation and trafficking immune 
                              system cells out into the tissues. 
                              If we look at the four key signs of inflammation, we can link them to key actions of the blood vessels.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When injury or infection occurs, the blood vessels in that area will dilate allowing more blood and immune 
                              cells to flow into that area. The blood is red, and it has a much higher temperature then the skin. The 
                              increased blood flow will lead to the redness and heat. The increased cellular activity in the area of 
                              damage will contribute to the increased heat. Blood vessels will also increase their permeability. The endothelial 
                              cells will shrink to increase the gap between them. This allows for the flow of blood, fluids, immune 
                              cells, antibodies and complement proteins to flow out of the blood vessel into the tissue. This flow out of 
                              the blood into the tissue leads to swelling also called edema. The swelling will increase pressure on the 
                              pain receptors in the area leading to pain. The overall influx of fluids and immune cells cause swelling which 
                              can immobilize joints leading to loss of function. Every sign we associate with inflammation comes from the 
                              increased blood flow to the injury by the opening up of endothelial linings.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              What causes these vascular events to occur? The initial reaction is caused my neurogenic and myogenic responses 
                              to injury. The nerves and muscles respond first. Then the many inflammatory cytokines and mediators that 
                              are released by the sentry cells in the local area will contribute to inlfammation. They can even start inflammation 
                              if an infection with no injury. Local Sentry and Mast Cell release things like Histamine, Prostaglandins, 
                              Leukotrienes, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin 1 (IL-1), C3a and C5a.  Inflammation is broken down 
                              into 2 categories based on where it starts. I have gone through so many immunology courses and they always 
                              focus on inflammation of cytokines released from immune cells, but never focus on inflammation of tissue 
                              damage.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="acid">Arachidonic Acid Pathway</h2>
                         <p>  
                              The response of inflammation from cellular damage pathway can happen from physical trauma like a cut, 
                              break or burn. It can also happen from pathogens that release toxins. Bacteria will release toxins that 
                              cause cell damage. Even immune cells like the neutrophils, when they fight the bacteria, will release 
                              their enzymes that can damage cells. This is why chronic inflammation leads to tissue damage and 
                              fibrosis (scar tissue). Chronic Inflammation can also lead to tumor genesis.
                         </p>   
                         <p>
                              All cells have a membrane made up of a phospholipids. When they get damaged, these phospholipids can be 
                              knocked loose into the tissue. These phospholipid break down into Arachidonic Acid. These free phospholipids 
                              will be changed by and enzyme called Phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The PLA2 will break down the phospholipid 
                              into Arachidonic Acid (AA). The AA will be further broken down by two other enzymes that creates two 
                              further pathways.  Steroids like Prednisone will block Phospholipase A2 and thus block all the pathways of 
                              Arachidonic Acid. This is what makes it a powerful anti inflammatory drug.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first the Arachidonic Acid can take is the Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme pathway which breaks down 
                              the AA into Prostaglandins. The COX enzyme is the key target for Aspirin and all over the counter 
                              Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) like Ibuprofen. This blocks all the downstream effects 
                              of the prostaglandins. These prostaglandins will be used by the blood vessels to regulate vascular flow. 
                              In healthy tissues, the blood vessels will covert the Protaglandins to Prostacyclin (PGI2) to keep 
                              vessels dilated and flowing.  In injury, the blood vessels will convert the Prostaglandins to Thromboxane 
                              A2 (TXA2) to do vasoconstriction to slow blood flow. The reset of the prostaglandins will go on to 
                              produce fever and pain. PGE2 is the key prostaglandin of pain and fever. This is how taking over the 
                              counter pain relivers help reduce pain by blocking this entire COX pathway. Prostaglandins might play 
                              a role in pain and inflammation, but they also play a role in protection of the stomach lining from 
                              stomach acid. This is why taking NSAIDS will cause problems with the stomach. It blocks the prostaglandins 
                              that protect the stomach from the acid.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are also 2 forms of the COX enzyme with COX1 and COX2. They both have different effects and some 
                              drugs focus on affecting one more than the other. Most over the counter pain relivers block both. COX1 specific 
                              inhibitors will affect platelets and blood clotting. This had lead to the use of Aspirin for prevention of 
                              blood clots. It also raises the risk of bleeding events. That has led to development of COX2 specific 
                              inhibitors. COX2 is linked to PGE2 and its role in pain and fever. This had led to COX2 specific inhibitors 
                              that only target this part of the pathway. This allows the COX1 intact for normal blood clotting. It still 
                              blocks the protective prostaglandins that protect the stomach. Most over the counter pain medication block 
                              both of these pathways.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The second pathway the Arachidonic Acid can take is the Lipooxygenase (LOX) enzyme pathway which 
                              breaks down AA into Leukotrienes. The key leukotriene in inflammation is leukotriene B4 (LB4). This 
                              acts as a strong attractant for neutrophils and leads to swelling. The LB4 is produced by the AA pathway,
                              but its also produced by Mast Cells after they degranulate. Many of these inflammatory cytokines will 
                              be released by Mast Cells from pathogens. The rest of the Leukotrienes with LC4, LD4 and LE4 all play 
                              a role in bronchoconstriction. They are targets of medications in Asthma and other breathing disorders.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="cellular">Cellular Events</h2>
                         <p>
                              The other side of inflammation comes from the cells of the immune system responding to an 
                              infection and releasing proinflammatory cytokines. This begins with the sentry cells like mast 
                              cells and macrophages. They are the first responders to an infection. They release inflammatory 
                              substances that will go to the endothelial cells and begin vasodilation and increase permeability. 
                              The mast cells will release Histamine while the macrophage will release TNF-a and IL-1 or Interferrons.
                              The other inflammatory mediators that can act upon the endothelial cells are the C3a and C5a of the 
                              complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that can be activated by pathogens or 
                              antibodies to create inflammation.
                         </p>   
                         <p>
                              When the endothelial cells receive these cytokines and inflammatory mediators, the vessels will dilate 
                              and increase their permeability. The endothelial cells shrink to allow the flow of blood and proteins into 
                              the tissues, but not large enough for immune cells to pass through. The immune cells require a process 
                              called diapedesis which actively moves the immune cells from the blood into the tissue. This is called 
                              extravasation.  The process of diapedesis goes through several stages. First the selectins will be 
                              expressed by the endothelial cells and the immune cells such as neutrophils. The selectins on the immune 
                              cell will catch with the selectins on the endothelial cells causing them to slow down and roll along the 
                              side of the blood vessel wall. This is called rolling adhesion. The cytokines like IL-8 (CXCL8) will cause 
                              the endothelial cells and immune cells to express integrins like LFA-1 and VLA-4 on the immune cells. 
                              The endothelial cells will express ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 which will bind to the integrins of the immune 
                              cells. That will cause tight binding and the full stop of the immune cell. Next the PECAM ligand will 
                              bind to the CD-31 on the immune cell and pull it through the small opening.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first stages of immune cell driven inflammation is regulated by preformed elements released by 
                              granules from inside of the cells. This starts with the activation of Mast Cells and their degranulation 
                              releasing Histamine. The Histamine will act upon the endothelial cells causing them to release the contents 
                              of their granules called Weibel Palade Bodies. They contain P selectins which will be expressed by the 
                              endothelial cells. The initial activation of the endothelial cells with histamine and P selectins starts 
                              within seconds and lasts for the first hour or two. After that, the sentry cells like macrophages will 
                              process antigens and begin expressing proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-a and IL-1. These cytokines are 
                              not expressed immediately as they actually takes time to be produced. The endothelial cells will release 
                              their P selectins as part of their Weibel Palade Bodies initially. Then they will express the E selectins 
                              later in response to the TNF-a and IL-1.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The acute phase reaction is part of inflammation and starts when the sentry cells begin releasing 
                              cytokines like TNF-a, IL-1, and IL-6. The IL-6 will go to the liver and begin the production of critical 
                              proteins necessary in the immune response. One of them will be the production of all the complement 
                              proteins. Next will be the creation of C reactive Protein (CRP). The increased production of ferritin for 
                              binding and storing iron is a critical actue phase reactant that plays a big role in chronic inflammation 
                              and Anemia of Chronic Disease. The CRP protein will bind to phosphocholine that is expressed by damaged or 
                              dying cells. CRP will bind to these receptors and trigger the classical complement pathway. The measure of 
                              CRP is a key indicator for inflammation. Other key immune proteins will also be produced like mannose 
                              binding lectin (MBL) for the complement system. 
                         </p>

                              The acute phase reaction will include the fever caused by the TNF-a and IL-1 in the hypothalamus. These are 
                              all the effects of cellular inflammation from the first activation of Mast Cells releasing quick acting 
                              inflammatory signals. It acts on the Endothelial cells that will reinforce the neurogenic and myogenic reactions 
                              caused by injury. It can initiate the inflammatory process in case of infection. The brings more immune cells into 
                              the tissue. The Antigen Presenting Cells in the tissue will process antigens and release more cytokines to 
                              enhance the inflammatory process. Other elements like complement can come into the space and trigger from 
                              pathogens. The activation of complement can further enhance inflammation. Damage to cells will call into 
                              action the Arachidonic Acid pathway and even more inflammatory mediators like Prostaglandins and 
                              Leukotrienes. The inflammation process is a coordinated and multi system response to damage or infection.
