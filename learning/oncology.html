                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="cellcycle">The Cell Cycle</h2>
                         <p> 
                              I wanted to give a simplified overview of the cell signaling that drives a cell through the growth cycle 
                              before we get into oncology and look at all the things that can go wrong. Most cells will spend the bulk 
                              of their time in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. This means they are mature and carrying out their daily functions. It is 
                              only when they are given growth signals do they enter the cell cycle and replicate. The cell cycle is 
                              highly controlled and regulated. There is a massive amount of regulation on controlling cell division. 
                              This is to prevent uncontrolled growth which leads to cancer.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are genes that promote growth and we call them proto oncogenes. They are capable of driving cancer, 
                              but they won't when they are normal and healthy. A proto oncogene is one that normally helps drive the cell
                              through the cell cycle. When they mutate, they can break free from regulation and drive uncontrolled growth.
                              Then they are called oncogenes. There are other genes that block cell growth without the proper signals to 
                              advance the cell through the cell cycle. We call these tumor suppressor genes. These can be lost by 
                              mutations that renders them inactive. These act like the breaks for the cell cycle and prevent the cell from
                              going through the cell cycle unless they have the proper signals. The loss of a tumor suppressor gene can 
                              allow uncontrolled cell growth.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The signal for the cell to enter the cell cycle comes in the form of growth factors. There are a ton 
                              of them like Epidermal Growth Factor, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and many more. These growth 
                              factors all have the same role but for different tissues. It all starts when the growth factor binds to 
                              its receptor on the cell surface. It will initiate a signaling cascade of the growth pathways inside the 
                              cell. They are the MAPK and mTOR pathways that mainly drive cell growth. These 2 pathways will activate
                              key transcription factors that will enter the nucleus and activate key genes. Those genes will produce proteins
                              that will help push the cell into the cell cycle. At the same time, they will release the tumor suppressor 
                              genes like GSK3-Beta that prevent the cell going through the cell cycle. The combination of growth gene 
                              activation and tumor suppressor proteins suppression will allow the cell cycle to start.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The deactivation of GSK3-Beta will allow the first Cyclin with Cyclin D to build within the cell which pushes 
                              the cell into G1 phase of the cycle. At the End of the G1 phase the cell will go through a checkpoint to 
                              ensure all the DNA is ready to be copied and no problems exist with the DNA. The DNA Repair pathways act as 
                              another set of breaks for the cell cycle. If anything goes wrong with the DNA the DDR pathways will stop 
                              the cell cycle. If the DNA is good, the cell proceeds to the S phase of the cycle.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              In the S phase of the cycle, the DNA will go through the long process of copying itself. Every chromosome 
                              has to be copied and checked for quality. There are several cyclins and proteins that regulate the initiation 
                              and termination of the DNA synthesis. These are things like Cyclin E and Cyclin A along with Cyclin Dependent 
                              Kinases like CDK1 and CDK2. These pathways are complex and mutations in the many proteins that drive them 
                              can lead to errors in the DNA or over activation of the cell cycle.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              That last stage is the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This is where the DNA is checked before the cell is allowed 
                              to enter the process of Mitosis. There is a checkpoint at the end of the G2 phase called the G2/M checkpoint.
                              Here the DDR pathways will make sure the DNA is good before allowing the cell to proceed to Mitosis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Mitosis is the complex process by which each and every chromosome will line up and be separated into 2 groups.
                              Each new cell has to get a copy of each and every chromosome. Errors anywhere in the cell cycle can cause 
                              cancer. There are dozens of protiens, transcription factors, enzymes and checkpoints that could mutate to
                              create either gain of function mutations in the proto oncogenes that drive the cell cycle, or they can be 
                              a loss of fuction mutation in a tumor suppressor gene. Either of these types of mutation can push the cell into 
                              the cell cycle and drive cancer growth. 
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="whatis">What is Cancer?</h2>
                         <p> 
                              The definition of cancer is uncontrolled growth. It is a genetically driven disease. It begins with the 
                              accumulation of genetic mutations in a cell over time. One mutation alone will not lead to cancer. Some people 
                              are born with enough mutated genes to give them cancer at birth. Some people are born with genes that give 
                              them a predisposition toward cancer, but that does not mean they will certainly get it. They are at higher 
                              risk. Genetic mutations in key proto oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes can give a person a higher risk for 
                              cancer. It takes a series of mutations over time to accumulate all the traits of cancer in one cell. 
                              There are two major factors that contribute to the formation of cancer with genetics and environment.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Genetics is what we are born with, and we could have a higher risk for cancer in our genes. Environmental 
                              exposure and life style choices contribute to the accumulated mutations to our genes over the course of our 
                              lifetimes. We can inherit specific genes that give us a predisposition toward a specific type of cancer. 
                              That does not mean we will get that cancer, but it can significantly increase the odds. The environment plays 
                              a major role in causing cell mutations. The biggest factor in cancer development are acquired mutations 
                              over time caused by chemicals or pollutants. We call these factors carcinogens. Some types of carcinogens 
                              in cancer are UV light from the sun or chemicals from cigarette smoking. Even the Oxidative stress caused 
                              by our own immune systems can cause mutations. Chronic Inflammation is a large cause of cancer.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Surveillance toward cancer is the job of the immune system. The immune system is designed to 
                              find and kill any mutated cells, and it does so all the time without us ever knowing it. The formation of 
                              a tumor begins when all the genetic variables come together for a mutated cell to escape the immune 
                              defenses and grow uncontrolled.

                              A solid tumor gets named based on the tissue in which it begins. The Carcinoma is found in the epithelial 
                              tissue that makes up the skin that lines both the outside and inside of the body. Sarcoma is found in 
                              the connective tissues and bones. About 85% to 90% of solid tumors are Carcinomas made up of organ 
                              tissue epithelial cells. The other 10% to 15% are Sarcomas made up of bone and connective tissue cancers.
                              Carcinoma is further divided into two subcategories of Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The 
                              Adenocarcinoma forms inside the tissue of the organs while the Squamous Cell Carcinoma forms in the skin 
                              that covers the organs. Most solid tumors will fall into the Carcinoma.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Blood Cancers are made up of Leukemia and Lymphoma. Leukemia is the cancer of the blood 
                              and starts in the bone marrow. It can spread into the circulation and even evolve to become a Lymphoma. 
                              Leukemia is a cancer of White Blood Cells. Leukemia is broken down in myelocytic and lymphocytic forms. 
                              The myelocytic form is made up of the cell lines that come from granulocytes, mainly neutrophils, while 
                              the lymphocytic form is made up of cells from the T cell or B cell lines. Acute Leukemia develops rapidly 
                              while chronic develops over the 
                              long term. You will never see a child with a chronic leukemia. All the childhood leukemia are acute. Lymphoma 
                              is a cancer that originates in the lymph nodes of the lymph system. It's a solid tumor and gets named 
                              based on which cell lines it originates in and which parts of the lymph nodes where it begins. Lymphoma is 
                              broken down into two kinds of Hodgkin's Lymphoma accounting for 5% of lymphoma and Non Hodgkin Lymphoma 
                              (NHL) accounting for 95% of lymphoma. NHL is further broken down into many subtypes.

                              About 14 million new cancers are diagnosed around the world each year and about 8 million people die from 
                              cancer each year. Lung cancer makes up about 12% of all cancers and affects about 235,000 people in the 
                              US each year. About 85% of lung cancer falls into Non Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC). It makes up the 
                              largest subset with small cell lung cancer making about 15%. Many lung cancers are diagnosed when they 
                              are advanced as they are hard to detect early. Up to 80% off all lung cancers stem from smoking. There are 
                              a lot of environmental contributing factors for lung cancers, especially occupational for firefighters.

                              Breast cancer makes up about 12% of all cancers and affects about 285,000 people in the US each year. 
                              Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Annual screening has led to a 
                              significant reduction in deaths related to breast cancer. About 70% to 80% of breast cancers are ductal 
                              cancers. This cancer has a huge genetic component with the BRCA gene which dramatically drives up the 
                              risk of breast cancer. Age and genetics are the largest contributing factors to breast cancer.

                              Prostate cancer makes up about 8% of all cancers and affects about 248,000 men in the 
                              US each year. It leads to about 27,000 deaths each year. It is the second lead cause of cancer death for 
                              men. It is another cancer where screening can catch it early and significantly improve outcomes. The 
                              highest risk factor is age with 60% of cases in men over 65. There is a PSA test that can easily be used 
                              yearly as a screen.

                              Colon cancer makes up 10% of all cancers and affects about 105,000 people in the US each year. This is 
                              one of those cancers that can be caught and treated early with testing. The survival rate is high when caught
                              early. Still, around 50,000 people die every year from Colon Cancer. The top risks for Colon cancer are 
                              age, diet, lifestyle such as smoking, and other illnesses like Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

                              Liver cancer makes up about 700,000 cases worldwide every year and 42,000 in the US. It is far more common 
                              outside the US. The death rate is extremely high in Liver cancer as it goes undetected often until it's 
                              too late. It is twice as common for men as women. Chronic viruses of the liver like Hepatitis are the 
                              leading cause of liver cancer. Drinking and cirrhosis is another major factor that contributes to liver 
                              cancer.

                              Skin cancer is one of the largest cancers in America with Melanoma making up about 1% of skin cancers. 
                              Melanoma affects about 77,000 people in the US each year.  This one is of particular interest as it has 
                              a high genetic component with the BRAF V600E mutations. The number one risk factor is sun exposure.
