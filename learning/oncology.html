                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="cellcycle">The Cell Cycle</h2>
                         <p> 
                              I wanted to give a simplified overview of the cell signaling that drives a cell through the growth cycle 
                              before we get into oncology and look at all the things that can go wrong. Most cells will spend the bulk 
                              of their time in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. This means they are mature and carrying out their daily functions. It is 
                              only when they are given growth signals do they enter the cell cycle and replicate. The cell cycle is 
                              highly controlled and regulated. There is a massive amount of regulation on controlling cell division. 
                              This is to prevent uncontrolled growth which leads to cancer.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are genes that promote growth and we call them proto oncogenes. They are capable of driving cancer, 
                              but they won't when they are normal and healthy. A proto oncogene is one that normally helps drive the cell
                              through the cell cycle. When they mutate, they can break free from regulation and drive uncontrolled growth.
                              Then they are called oncogenes. There are other genes that block cell growth without the proper signals to 
                              advance the cell through the cell cycle. We call these tumor suppressor genes. These can be lost by 
                              mutations that render them inactive. These act like the breaks for the cell cycle and prevent the cell from
                              going through the cell cycle unless they have the proper signals. The loss of a tumor suppressor gene can 
                              allow uncontrolled cell growth.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The signal for the cell to enter the cell cycle comes in the form of growth factors. There are a ton 
                              of them like Epidermal Growth Factor, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and many more. These growth 
                              factors all have the same role but for different tissues. It all starts when the growth factor binds to 
                              its receptor on the cell surface. It will initiate a signaling cascade of the growth pathways inside the 
                              cell. They are the MAPK and mTOR pathways that mainly drive cell growth. These 2 pathways will activate
                              key transcription factors that will enter the nucleus and activate key genes. Those genes will produce proteins
                              that will help push the cell into the cell cycle. At the same time, they will release the tumor suppressor 
                              genes like GSK3-Beta that prevent the cell going through the cell cycle. The combination of growth gene 
                              activation and tumor suppressor protein suppression will allow the cell cycle to start.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The deactivation of GSK3-Beta will allow the first Cyclin with Cyclin D to build within the cell which pushes 
                              the cell into G1 phase of the cycle. At the End of the G1 phase the cell will go through a checkpoint to 
                              ensure all the DNA is ready to be copied and no problems exist with the DNA. The DNA Repair pathways act as 
                              another set of breaks for the cell cycle. If anything goes wrong with the DNA the DDR pathways will stop 
                              the cell cycle. If the DNA is good, the cell proceeds to the S phase of the cycle.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              In the S phase of the cycle, the DNA will go through the long process of copying itself. Every chromosome 
                              has to be copied and checked for quality. There are several cyclins and proteins that regulate the initiation 
                              and termination of the DNA synthesis. These are things like Cyclin E and Cyclin A along with Cyclin Dependent 
                              Kinases like CDK1 and CDK2. These pathways are complex and mutations in the many proteins that drive them 
                              can lead to errors in the DNA or over activation of the cell cycle.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              That last stage is the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This is where the DNA is checked before the cell is allowed 
                              to enter the process of Mitosis. There is a checkpoint at the end of the G2 phase called the G2/M checkpoint.
                              Here the DDR pathways will make sure the DNA is good before allowing the cell to proceed to Mitosis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Mitosis is the complex process by which each and every chromosome will line up and be separated into 2 groups.
                              Each new cell has to get a copy of each and every chromosome. Errors anywhere in the cell cycle can cause 
                              cancer. There are dozens of proteins, transcription factors, enzymes and checkpoints that could mutate to
                              create either gain of function mutations in the proto-oncogenes that drive the cell cycle, or they can be 
                              a loss of function mutation in a tumor suppressor gene. Either of these types of mutation can push the cell into 
                              the cell cycle and drive cancer growth. 
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="whatis">What is Cancer?</h2>
                         <p> 
                              The definition of cancer is uncontrolled growth. It is a genetically driven disease. It begins with the 
                              accumulation of genetic mutations in a cell over time. One mutation alone will not lead to cancer. Some people 
                              are born with enough mutated genes to give them cancer at birth. Some people are born with genes that give 
                              them a predisposition toward cancer, but that does not mean they will certainly get it. They are at higher 
                              risk. Genetic mutations in key proto oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes can give a person a higher risk for 
                              cancer. It takes a series of mutations over time to accumulate all the traits of cancer in one cell. 
                              There are two major factors that contribute to the formation of cancer with genetics and environment.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Genetics is what we are born with, and we could have a higher risk for cancer in our genes. Environmental 
                              exposure and lifestyle choices contribute to the accumulated mutations to our genes over the course of our 
                              lifetimes. We can inherit specific genes that give us a predisposition toward a specific type of cancer. 
                              That does not mean we will get that cancer, but it can significantly increase the odds. The environment plays 
                              a major role in causing cell mutations. The biggest factor in cancer development are acquired mutations 
                              over time caused by chemicals or pollutants. We call these factors carcinogens. Some types of carcinogens 
                              in cancer are UV light from the sun or chemicals from cigarette smoking. Even the Oxidative stress caused 
                              by our own immune systems can cause mutations. Chronic Inflammation is a large cause of cancer.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Surveillance toward cancer is the job of the immune system. The immune system is designed to 
                              find and kill any mutated cells, and it does so all the time without us ever knowing it. The formation of 
                              a tumor begins when all the genetic variables come together for a mutated cell to escape the immune 
                              defenses and grow uncontrolled.

                         <p> 
                              A solid tumor gets named based on the tissue in which it begins. A Carcinoma is found in the epithelial 
                              tissue that makes up the skin that lines both the outside and inside of the body. Sarcoma is found in 
                              the connective tissues and bones. About 85% to 90% of solid tumors are Carcinomas made up of organ 
                              tissue epithelial cells. The other 10% to 15% are Sarcomas made up of bone and connective tissue cancers.
                              Carcinoma is further divided into two subcategories of Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The 
                              Adenocarcinoma forms inside the tissue of the organs while the Squamous Cell Carcinoma forms in the skin 
                              that covers the organs. Most solid tumors will fall into the Carcinoma.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Blood Cancers are made up of Leukemia and Lymphoma. Leukemia is the cancer of the blood 
                              and starts in the bone marrow. It can spread into the circulation and even evolve to become a Lymphoma. 
                              Leukemia is a cancer of White Blood Cells. Leukemia is broken down in myelocytic and lymphocytic forms. 
                              The myelocytic form is made up of the cell lines that come from granulocytes, mainly neutrophils, while 
                              the lymphocytic form is made up of cells from the T cell or B cell lines. Acute Leukemia develops rapidly 
                              while chronic develops over the 
                              long term. You will never see a child with chronic leukemia. All childhood leukemia is acute. Lymphoma 
                              is a cancer that originates in the lymph nodes of the lymph system. It's a solid tumor and gets named 
                              based on which cell lines it originates in and which parts of the lymph nodes where it begins. Lymphoma is 
                              broken down into two kinds of Hodgkin's Lymphoma accounting for 5% of lymphoma and Non Hodgkin Lymphoma 
                              (NHL) accounting for 95% of lymphoma. NHL is further broken down into many subtypes.
                         </p>

                              About 14 million new cancers are diagnosed around the world each year and about 8 million people die from 
                              cancer each year. Lung cancer makes up about 12% of all cancers and affects about 235,000 people in the 
                              US each year. About 85% of lung cancer falls into Non Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC). It makes up the 
                              largest subset with small cell lung cancer making about 15%. Many lung cancers are diagnosed when they 
                              are advanced as they are hard to detect early. Up to 80% off all lung cancers stem from smoking. There are 
                              a lot of environmental contributing factors for lung cancers, especially occupational for firefighters.

                              Breast cancer makes up about 12% of all cancers and affects about 285,000 people in the US each year. 
                              Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women. Annual screening has led to a 
                              significant reduction in deaths related to breast cancer. About 70% to 80% of breast cancers are ductal 
                              cancers. This cancer has a huge genetic component with the BRCA gene which dramatically drives up the 
                              risk of breast cancer. Age and genetics are the largest contributing factors to breast cancer.

                              Prostate cancer makes up about 8% of all cancers and affects about 248,000 men in the 
                              US each year. It leads to about 27,000 deaths each year. It is the second leading cause of cancer death for 
                              men. It is another cancer where screening can catch it early and significantly improve outcomes. The 
                              highest risk factor is age with 60% of cases in men over 65. There is a PSA test that can easily be used 
                              yearly as a screen.

                              Colon cancer makes up 10% of all cancers and affects about 105,000 people in the US each year. This is 
                              one of those cancers that can be caught and treated early with testing. The survival rate is high when caught
                              early. Still, around 50,000 people die every year from Colon Cancer. The top risks for Colon cancer are 
                              age, diet, lifestyle such as smoking, and other illnesses like Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

                              Liver cancer makes up about 700,000 cases worldwide every year and 42,000 in the US. It is far more common 
                              outside the US. The death rate is extremely high in Liver cancer as it goes undetected often until it's 
                              too late. It is twice as common for men as women. Chronic viruses of the liver like Hepatitis are the 
                              leading cause of liver cancer. Drinking and cirrhosis is another major factor that contributes to liver 
                              cancer.

                              Skin cancer is one of the largest cancers in America with Melanoma making up about 1% of skin cancers. 
                              Melanoma affects about 77,000 people in the US each year.  This one is of particular interest as it has 
                              a high genetic component with the BRAF V600E mutations. The number one risk factor is sun exposure.

                         <p> 
                              On average, when the DNA polymerase copies the DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle, it makes a 
                              mistake once in every 1 billion base pairs. That means each cell makes about 3 mistakes each time it 
                              replicates. The DNA polymerase has proofreading ability and catches the vast majority of these errors 
                              and fixes them, but some errors to get through. Most of the DNA damage will come from environmental events 
                              like UV light, Radical Oxygen Species, and chemicals.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There is a set of proteins and enzymes that are designed to find and repair different kinds of DNA damage. 
                              If it is just a single base error, then the DNA Damage Repair (DDR) proteins will undergo Base Excision 
                              Repair (BER). This is where the specific base is removed and fixed. It can be a deamination of a cytosine, 
                              a depurination or even an alkylation of a base. The BER enzymes will flip the base out from the DNA and cut 
                              it loose from the carbon bonds. One of these DNA repair enzymes is Uracil DNA Glycosylase (UNG). This targets 
                              and repairs deamination events which occur thousands of times a day from environmental factors. This 
                              happens when the A or T loses its amino group. The UNG repairs these deamination events.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              If damage involves two bases, like those two bases becoming bound to each other called a pyrimidine dimer, 
                              then the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) kicks in. The binding together of two bases is a common type of 
                              damage from things like chemicals and UV light. When that happens the NER repair will remove and replace 
                              a section of the DNA strand. It binds to a single strand of the DNA about 2 twists apart or 24 bases and 
                              removes a section of the stand. NER will fix what is called bulky groups in the DNA. These are large multi 
                              ringed groups from carcinogens and chemicals. They get into the DNA and need to be removed by NER. This is 
                              a process which chemotherapy drugs exploit.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When both strands of DNA get broken in what is called a Double Stranded Break (DSB), other sets of repair 
                              proteins will go to work. The process of Non Homologous End Joining is the most inaccurate way for DNA 
                              repair. This process basically takes two ends of DNA and glues them back together. It doesn't even care if 
                              they belong together. A second method can be used for DSB with Homology Directed Repair. This will take 
                              the matching chromosome and use it as a template to repair the break. Homology Directed Repair (HDR) is 
                              only available when the cell is going through mitosis and a sister chromatid is available to use as a 
                              template for directing repair. The vast majority of the time, the cell will be using Non Homologous End 
                              Joining (NHEJ). The Double Stranded Break (DSB) is the worst possible damage to the DNA as the process of 
                              NHEJ will typically do the repair by adding or removing bases. These are called insertions and deletions 
                              (Indels) and they can throw off the entire gene.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When it is only 1 strand of DNA that gets broken, the DNA will undergo Single Strand Break Repair. This 
                              is the pathway where the famous BRCA gene exists. It takes the good strand of DNA and uses it as a template 
                              to repair the broken strand. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The DDR machinery is designed to find and fix the damaged DNA. When something gets too bad for these mechanisms, 
                              then the cell will undergo programmed cell death. Mutations in the DDR repair mechanisms will lead to genetic 
                              instability which will allow the cell to accumulate more mutations at a faster rate. Loss of DNA repair 
                              will lead to chromosomal rearrangements.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There is a new approach to targeting cancer called Synthetic Lethality. This uses the defects in the DDR repair
                              pathways that allow cancer to gain faster mutations against the cancer to push it into such instability 
                              that it initiates programmed cell death called Apoptosis. This is like the bar stool approach. If you have a 
                              four legged bar stool and a leg breaks, it might have only three legs, but it will most likely still stand 
                              up. If you take out another leg, then it becomes unstable and collapses. The process of Synthetic Lethality 
                              looks for mutated DDR pathways that promote cancer mutations. Then it looks for another point in the DDR 
                              pathways that can be knocked out to cause the cell to become so unstable it undergoes cell death.

                         <p> 
                               Point Mutations are one of the most common mutations in cancer. This is where a single base gets changed 
                               in the DNA. This can lead to an entirely new amino acid being encoded into the protein changing its 
                               behavior. Point Mutations come in 3 kinds. The first is the silent mutation. This where a base gets changed, 
                               but it still encodes the same amino acid. This can happen as there is some redundancy in the coding of 
                               amino acids. Some amino acids have multiple codons that create them. The second type of point mutation is 
                               the Nonsense mutation. This is where a stop codon is now placed early in the gene. You end up with only a 
                               truncated version of the protein which can be non functional or only partially functional. The final point 
                               mutation is the one we will deal with most of the time in cancer. This is where a single base changes and 
                               causes a different amino acid to be encoded. This is called a Missense mutation. These will often result 
                               in a protein with an altered function.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When this point mutation occurs in a proto oncogene, then it becomes an oncogene which will drive cancer. 
                              These mutations are labeled in a specific format. First is the letter for the amino acid that was supposed 
                              to be encoded. Then the number for the location of that amino acid in the protein. Last will be the letter 
                              for the new amino acid that was encoded. An example would be G12C. So, G12C means that a Glycine at the 
                              12th amino acid in the sequence was replaced with a Cysteine.  In proteins, the structure of a protein 
                              determines function. A single change like this can completely change its function. When this occurs in a 
                              proto oncogene, you can get increased growth signals that lead to rapid cell proliferation and cancer.
                              The alternative is a point mutation that can occur in a tumor suppressor gene like p53 and render it non 
                              functional. This causes the loss of that tumor suppressor gene. This removes the protection and brakes on 
                              the system which can lead to uncontrolled growth.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last possible mutation of a single base is called the frameshift mutation. Since every 3 bases makes up 
                              a single amino acid, if one base is removed or inserted, then the whole sequence of amino acids shifts. 
                              That makes it encode an all new set of amino acids from that point forward.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Now that we looked at DNA level mutations, we are now going to look at mutations that can occur at the 
                              chromosomal level. These can cause a whole gene to be inserted, deleted, inverted, duplicated or even 
                              translocated. The first set of mutations are insertions or deletions. This is where a single gene gets 
                              deleted or duplicated. A duplication of a gene can happen many times. This is sometimes the case in cancer. 
                              When a gene for a growth factor gets copied 20 times. In the same way, the deletion of a tumor suppressor 
                              gene will lead to a loss of function for that gene. The other alternative is a gene inversion. That means 
                              the gene gets flipped around so it is now read backwards. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The last chromosomal level change can be what is 
                              called a translocation. This is where one section of DNA gets taken from one chromosome and placed on 
                              another. When a gene for a growth signal ends up being translocated to a region of the chromosome where 
                              it is placed behind a promoter which is highly active, you now have a highly active growth signal. This is 
                              what occurs in the famous Philadelphia Chromosome with the 9/22 translocation. This is where part of 
                              chromosome 9 and part of chromosome 22 are exchanged. The gene BCR gets translocated so that it is fused 
                              with the ABL gene which results in hyper active growth signaling. This is the most common translocation in 
                              Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). There are many other kinds of translocations that can occur. Not all 
                              translocations are reciprocal. That is where 2 segments of a chromosome are exchanged. Sometimes they are 
                              one sided. That is where a section of one chromosome just gets broken off and placed on another.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last issue with chromosomes is called Aneuploidy. This occurs when the cells go through mitosis. 
                              We know all chromosomes have 2 copies with one set coming from each parent. We have 23 pairs of 
                              chromosomes. During mitosis the DNA gets copied so that each new cell gets a full set. That means 
                              after the DNA is copied, that cell has 4 copies of each of the chromosomes. When an error occurs 
                              during mitosis, you can end up with too many or too few chromosomes ending up in a single daughter cell. 
                              This can lead to dosing issues with having too many growth signals in that new cell. You might end up with 
                              1 daughter cell with 1 copy of a chromosome and another with 3 copies.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All these possible mutations that can happen will often happen in cancer at some point. This brings us to 
                              the concept of chromothripsis. This is where a single mutation leads to genomic instability. That allows 
                              more mutations to happen which leads to more mutations to happen. Then you end up with cancer cells who 
                              have chromosomes and DNA that are all scrambled up. This creates an environment of rapid evolution. The 
                              tumor becomes a battlefield of survival of the fittest. Every new cell has new mutations which battles with 
                              every other cancer cell for survival. The tumor will have a ton of cells dying as they fail, but some will 
                              survive and thrive. This battle for resources inside the tumor is what eventually leads to invasion and 
                              metastasis. This wide possibility of mutations demonstrates the vast genetic variation within a single tumor 
                              let alone within different patients. There can be hundreds of mutations inside a single tumor and not  
                              every cell will have them all.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="oncogenes">Cancer Genes</h2>
                         <p> 
                              A Proto-oncogene is one of those genes that drives cell growth through the cell cycle which can mutate and 
                              become an oncogene that drives cancer growth. These are the many genes that make up the growth receptors and 
                              signal transduction pathways inside a cell. There are a lot of these growth factor receptors on the surface 
                              of cells. They fall into families like Epidermal Growth Factor, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Platelet 
                              Derived Growth Factor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, and many more. When mutations occur in these receptors, they 
                              can stay in the on state even when there are no growth signals around to activate them. This drives the 
                              cell into the cell cycle and promotes cell proliferation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next set of proto oncogenes occupy the transduction pathways that translate the activation of the growth 
                              receptor into the nucleus. These genes are the cascades of proteins and enzymes inside the cell that translate 
                              receptor activation into gene activation inside the nucleus. These are broken down into specific pathways 
                              that control specific functions of the cell. They fall into the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway 
                              and the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. There are others like the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways.
                              These pathways are made up of many key proto-oncogenes that can mutate like RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK, PI3K, AKT, 
                              and so many more. When these proteins mutate the growth of the cell can be locked into an always on state. There 
                              are groups of tumor suppressor genes in these same pathways like NF-1 deactivates RAS and PTEN deactivates PI3K. 
                              These tumor suppressor genes ensure when things get turned on that they also get turned back off. The loss of them 
                              can leave the pathway turned on all the time.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last set of proto oncogenes are in the control of the cell cycle. The cell cycle is governed by the Cyclins 
                              and the Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDK). There are many other proteins and enzymes in the cell cycle 
                              checkpoints. Mutations in any of them can allow the cell to advance through the cycle without proper growth 
                              signals. Any of these Cyclins or CDK proteins can become oncogenes when they mutate. The tumor suppressor genes 
                              are those that block the cell from growing when it's not required. Many of the growth pathways are 
                              regulated by factors that prevent them from being activated without the proper growth signals. In the cell cycle
                              these are genes like p53, p21 and Retinoblastoma.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The most famous of tumor suppressor genes is the p53 gene. It is known as the guardian of the genome. It is 
                              responsible for ensuring the integrity of the DNA and will stop cell growth when there is damage to DNA. 
                              It can even initiate cell death if damage is too bad. p53 is activated by all of the DDR pathways to arrest the cell 
                              cycle for DNA damage repair. There are other internal checkpoints the cell must clear during the growth 
                              cycle to ensure everything is good before allowing it to move to the next stage of growth.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The loss of a key tumor 
                              suppressor gene is called a loss of function mutation. If you have 1 good copy of a tumor suppressor gene, 
                              it will still function. It takes a loss of both alleles of these genes to lose function. Many times in cancer 
                              a tumor suppressor gene like p53 is lost, but not by mutation. They become silenced by epigenetic 
                              forces such as methylation from carcinogens. The cell growth cycle is held in a delicate balance between these growth 
                              forces and tumor suppressor forces. When there is a mutation that tips the scales in either direction, you 
                              get increased cellular growth.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="targets">Targeted Therapies</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Current Chemotherapies take a very broad approach to trying to stop cancer. They tend to have good 
                              efficacy but carry a lot of side effects. They attempt to block cancer by inhibiting cell replication 
                              and growth. Some of them interfere with the process of mitosis by blocking the process through
                              inhibiting the centrosomes and spindles. Other chemotherapy agents will damage DNA to a point of 
                              cell death. Some do this by cross linking the DNA strands. These approaches are very broad and have 
                              side effects on healthy cells. They cause a lot of toxicity related to hair loss, GI problems and low 
                              cell counts in the blood. They inhibit all rapidly replicating cells good and bad. This includes some of the most 
                              rapidly developing cells in the body which are all the blood cells like red blood cells, platelets 
                              and white blood cells. This leads to anemia, clotting issues and risk of infections. This led to the 
                              concept of targeted therapies for fighting cancer. Targeted therapies have been a growing and evolving 
                              area of cancer treatment. Currently, it only affects a minor amount of patients as Chemotherapy, 
                              Surgery and Radiation still work for about 50% of patients.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Targeted therapies have grown in use over the past decade. For all they do, they still only apply to 
                              about 20% of cancer patients. They are very powerful drugs for those patients who do benefit from them.
                              Many of these drugs are a simple pill or a few pills each day. They are really easy to use for both 
                              doctors and patients. They do have side effects based on their gene of target, but not nearly as much 
                              as chemotherapy. There are a lot of different targeted therapy approaches so I will start with one that 
                              should now be very familiar to us. The growth pathways that drive cancer become the first group of 
                              targeted therapies. Targeted therapies started by targeting the growth receptors using antibodies. They bind to 
                              the receptor and block the binding of the growth factor. This works for cancers where they produce too 
                              many receptors or growth factors. The downside with this approach is it can't reach cancers that are driven by the pathways 
                              inside the cell. The proteins inside the cell mutate into an "always on" state. They no longer need a 
                              growth factor to stay active. That is where targeting growth pathways started.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first growth pathway to target was the receptor, but instead of using an antibody, they blocked 
                              the kinase that was responsible for activating the receptor. This prevented its activation. These drugs 
                              quickly took over as targeted therapies against growth factors. Antibodies required IV administration, but 
                              a small molecule inhibitor could be a pill just a few times a day. Next came the pathways that transduce 
                              the signal from the receptor to the nucleus of the cell. These are the MAPK and mTOR pathways with PI3K, 
                              RAS, RAF, and MEK. These are the most common mutated oncogenes that lead to the proteins that drive cancer 
                              growth. The first generations of these inhibitors were more toxic as they blocked the entire protein. 
                              They inhibited the Normal form (Wildtype) as well as the mutated forms of these proteins. Some of 
                              the proteins they inhibited were extremely toxic like PI3Ka. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The newer generations are focused on targeting just the mutated forms of the proteins. This has 
                              been very effective, but cancer always finds a way to mutate and gain resistance to these targeted 
                              inhibitors. This constant resistance by cancer leads to 2nd, 3rd and even 4th generation targeted 
                              therapies for the same target as the cancer mutates the sites where these drugs engage the target 
                              proteins. The newest generation of inhibitors in the growth pathways have been using AI to guide 
                              smarter development to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity. The latest data from Relay in FGFR2 is 
                              very promising for these AI guided drug developers.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last major frontier in pathways has been those inside the cell like the cell cycle and DDR pathways. 
                              There are cancers where the oncogenes are driving things like Cyclin E which pushes the cell into the 
                              cell cycle. This has brought with it a new phase of targeted drugs that focus on the cell cycle like 
                              CDK2 or Wee1. There are a lot of new targets going on in the cell cycle now. I am sure they will not 
                              all be successful, but we will learn a lot from these attempts. The latest target has been the 
                              DNA Damage Repair pathways. Failure in this process leads to genomic instability which drives rapid 
                              mutation through possible chromosomal rearrangements. Losses of genes like p53 and BRCA1 are powerful 
                              cancer drivers. There is a lot of renewed interest in DDR genes. The major challenge to them is they 
                              are tumor suppressors. You just can't develop a drug that inhibits something. They need to be expressed, 
                              but they are being suppressed already in cancer.

                         <p> 
                              The term epigenetics means on top of genetics. This is the study of how DNA is packaged, regulated 
                              and expressed. The basic unit of DNA packaging is the nucleosome. The nucleosome includes all the histone 
                              proteins and DNA wrapped around them. It's about 150 base pairs of DNA wrapped twice around eight histone 
                              proteins. It also includes the small segment of DNA that links to the next nucleosome. There are two H2a, 
                              two H2b, two H3 and two H4 histone proteins made into an octamer. The tails on the histone proteins can 
                              be modified with different chemical groups like Acetyl groups, methyl groups, phosphates, and 
                              ubiquitination. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The patterns of modifications on these histone tails can increase or decrease the expression 
                              of that gene. If you add a methyl group to the promoter of the gene on the DNA, it can silence the gene. This 
                              happens to tumor suppressor genes that lead to cancer.  If you add that methyl group to the right place on 
                              the histone tail, it will increase expression of that gene. The addition and removal of acetyl groups on 
                              the histone tails will modify the charge on the histones and its ability to bind the negatively charged 
                              DNA. This addition or removal of acetyl groups is done by enzymes and will allow or deny access to that 
                              section of DNA for gene transcription. This is done by Histone Deacetylases (HDAC) and Histone 
                              Acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The way the DNA is packaged plays a big role in how genes are expressed, but it is not the only way the 
                              DNA gets regulated without actual DNA modification. The process for epigenetic regulation of genes is 
                              methylation of the promoter region. This is different from histone methylation which increases the 
                              expression of a gene. The DNA methylation occurs in the promoter region of the gene. The promoter region 
                              of the gene has regions called CpG rich islands. These are regions where more than 50% of the bases are 
                              cytosine and guanine rich. These CpG regions can become methylated by the addition of the methyl groups 
                              to the bases. This blocks the binding of the RNA polymerase and prevents expression of that gene. This 
                              can happen from environmental factors. There is an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) that adds 
                              these methyl groups. There are 2 versions. The first will add new methyl groups to the DNA adding to 
                              current methylation patterns on the DNA.  The second only replicates current DNA methylation patterns
                               as the DNA gets copied. So why in the world do cells need to methylate DNA anyway? This is how genes get 
                               silenced as the body develops and genes need to be turned off.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The process of Histone modification will alter how DNA is packaged and how genes within that Histone are 
                              expressed. The process of DNA methylation controls the promoter of that gene and if that gene gets 
                              transcribed or not. Epigenetics is all about understanding how our environment can alter the way our DNA 
                              expresses certain genes. It's about how the choices we make can alter the way our DNA expresses certain 
                              genes.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="hetero">Tumor Heterogeneity</h2>
                         <p> 
                              A tumor begins with just one mutation, but as the cells continue to replicate, it will begin to develop 
                              more and more mutations. Each generation will have new mutations the generation before it did not have.
                              This is the concept of the progression of cancer. A typical tumor will have at least 6 mutations before 
                              it even becomes cancer. There are several attributes we studied in the Hallmarks of Cancer each tumor 
                              must acquire before it becomes cancerous and can metastasize. This brings up the concept of Tumor Heterogeneity. 
                              The number of different mutations across a tumor can be dozens or even hundreds. Not every cell will have 
                              every mutation as each new generation of cells will gain mutations the generation before it did not have. The 
                              data even shows that cells that travel to distant parts of the body to create metastasis can evolve differently 
                              from the tumor they originated from. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Tumor heterogeneity can be very different across tumors within a single patient, and patients can have very 
                              wide tumor heterogeneity from one another. Cancer is a mutation in cells and those mutations can take any 
                              form and be completely random. The amount of tumor heterogeneity depends on the tumor type. Blood cancers seem 
                              to have less mutations and different antigens than solid tumors. They stem from immune cells which 
                              typically have clear antigens to target that are not on other healthy tissues. In B cell cancers, we can target 
                              BCMA, CD19 and CD22. These therapies will kill all B cells and have no effect on other healthy tissues. 
                              A human can live without B cells with supportive care. That makes it a very easy to treat cancers compared 
                              to solid tumors. When it comes to solid tumors, the amount of tumor heterogeneity often depends on the type of 
                              tumor; some will have only a handful of different mutations while others will have hundreds of mutations.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are 3 types of Tumor Heterogeneity we should understand. The first type of tumor heterogeneity which is the amount 
                              of different mutations within a single tumor or intratumor heterogeneity. Then there is inter-tumor heterogeneity that can be different mutations 
                              between different tumors within the same patient such as a tumor in the Lung and one in the Brain. Then there 
                              is inter patient tumor heterogeneity. That is the concept that one patient's tumor will mutate 
                              differently from another patient's tumor. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Chemotherapies do so well in cancer because they target rapidly dividing cells regardless of their mutations.
                              That is one of their major benefits despite their many side effects. Targeted therapies will often go after 
                              a specific mutation in a tumor, but not all cells in the tumor may have that mutation. The concept of tumor 
                              heterogeneity is very important in cancer as it makes it one of the most difficult diseases to treat.

                         <p> 
                              The immune system has the main role of removing pathogens, but it also has the role of removing 
                              harmful or unwanted cells that have mutated. This is because the immune system is the primary system 
                              for finding and removing mutated cells that are missed by DNA repair. The concept is called Immune 
                              Surveillance. There are cells within the immune system whose job it is to recognize a mutated cell and 
                              kill it. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The first is Antigen Presenting Cells. They clean up the dead cells inside a developing 
                              tumor. They can process these pieces of mutated proteins into antigens and present them to helper 
                              T cells. This provokes an immune response toward that antigen and clears tumor cells. The same T 
                              cell response which is designed to kill virally infected cells can be directed toward killing mutated 
                              cancer cells. This concept has brought about a whole new focus in biotechnology around redirecting these 
                              killer T cells for cancer therapies.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The other cell that is part of immune surveillance is the Natural Killer (NK) cell. These cells come with 
                              a group of receptors that are designed to find cells that are under stress. This can be things like proteins 
                              that are only supposed to be inside cells suddenly appearing on the surface of a cell. It could be just a 
                              lower level of MHC I expression on the cell surface. The NK cell is known as the primary immune 
                              surveillance cell. The NK cell has a host of receptors for detecting mutated cells. It is capable of triggering 
                              cell death just like cytotoxic T cells.

                         <p> 
                              There is a complex set of interactions that must go on between a tumor and its surroundings. It has to 
                              interact with the tissue cells, it needs nutrients, it needs oxygen, it needs to survive and proliferate in 
                              a hostile environment. One of the many things it has to achieve to exist and thrive is to overcome the 
                              immune system and its natural ability to find, target and destroy tumors. There are 3 key cells in the 
                              immune system that are designed to find and kill cells that are infected or defective. They are the Natural 
                              Killer (NK) cell, the Cytotoxic T cell, and the Macrophage. .
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The NK cells deploy a set of damage receptors 
                              called Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) that recognize stressed cells. This can be things like 
                              Mic-a or Mic-b and the lack of MHC I.
                              Normal cells will express MHC I on their surface that tells the immune system they are healthy. These MHC 
                              I receptors are made up of an alpha chain and a beta chain.  Defective cells will often display just 1 
                              chain called MIC-a for the MHC I related alpha chain or MIC-b for the MHC I related beta chain. This is 
                              just one of the many ways NK cells can recognize an unhealthy cancer cell.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The Cytotoxic T cells can detect Tumor Associated Antigens (TAA) which are just mutated versions of the 
                              normal self proteins. This can cause T cell activation and a cell mediated response. The Cytotoxic T cells 
                              will bind to and kill tumor cells that display their antigen. The last cells that are key are the Antigen 
                              Presenting Cells (APCs) like the Dendritic cells and Macrophage. The tumor not only competes with the 
                              healthy tissue for survival, but the cancer cells will battle each other in a survival of the fittest.
                              There is a lot of cell death going on in the tumor. This naturally allows APCs like the Macrophage to 
                              clean up these dead cells and process TAA antigens. They can present these antigens to the T cells to 
                              activate a response.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              One of the hallmarks of tumor progression is the tumor evolves mechanisms to evade the immune response. There 
                              are multiple ways the tumor can evade or redirect the immune system. The most common is the tumor cells will 
                              release signals that will induce T regulatory cells and Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) to protect the 
                              tumor by promoting tolerance. These cells will release signals that inactivate the immune cells like 
                              T cells, NK cells and APCs. This is one of these hardest effects to overcome in the tumor microenvironment. 
                              One effective way to clear all the miss directed regulatory cells is the use of a lymphodepletion regiment 
                              like Flu/Cy. This works in cell therapies to clear the battlefield.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next mechanism the tumor cells will deploy is the expression of suppressive receptors like PD-1, CTLA-4 
                              and CD-47. These will engage with T cells, NK cells and Macrophages and inhibit them from tumor killing. We 
                              call them checkpoints as they stop the immune response. This inhibitory response by a cell is designed to protect 
                              healthy cells from accidental killing by the immune system. The cancer cells will over express these inhibitory
                              receptors to protect them from the immune system. There is a huge amount of development going on to understand 
                              all the interactions between the immune cells and the tumor. There has been some great success with PD-1 
                              and CTLA-4 and a lot of disappointments along the way trying to develop checkpoint inhibitors. Some of the early 
                              developing checkpoints are LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT and CD47. All of these are natural receptors used by healthy 
                              cells to block the immune system from killing them.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The critical role of the immune system in protecting us from cancer has been well established by following 
                              patients who are immunosuppressed from cancer treatments or organ transplants. Immunocompromised patients have 
                              a significantly higher risk for cancer. Even HIV patients will have higher risk of cancer related to the 
                              immune suppression by the virus. Some cancer patients get secondary cancers while their immune systems are 
                              suppressed from chemotherapy. The role of the immune system in oncology is now well established. The many 
                              interactions that play a role in cancer surviving in a healthy immune system is still developing, but 
                              establishing therapies to return the balance back to the immune system can help fight cancer.
