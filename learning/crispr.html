                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="intro">Intro to CRISPR</h2>
                         <p>     
                              What does CRISPR stand for? It stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. 
                              This was discovered by scientists studying bacteria. Bacteria get infected by viruses called 
                              Bacteriophages. They attach to the bacteria and inject their viral DNA. Scientists noticed that the 
                              bacterial genome had a sequence of repeats. It showed a small sequence of DNA then a repeat followed by 
                              another small sequence and another repeat. They named this area of the bacteria genome the CRISPR region. 
                              This is the bacteria's immune system.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              It works through type 1 CRISPR enzymes like CAS1 and CAS2, chopping up the bacteria DNA. Then a small 
                              sequence of the viral DNA called the protospacer is inserted into the CRISPR region of the bacteria 
                              genome. What happens next is very awesome. The bacteria transcribes the entire CRISPR region into one 
                              long messenger RNA called the pre-transcript. This gets chopped up so each DNA sequence that matches 
                              the virus' protospacer becomes the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and the repeat becomes the trans activating 
                              RNA (tracrRNA). The repeat segments become the tracrRNA that will get loaded into an enzyme called CAS9. 
                              CAS9 stands for CRISPR Associated Protein 9. The CAS9 will recognize the tracrRNA and bind to it.
                              The crRNA will then bind to the tracrRNA to make a complete guide RNA. The two RNA segments bind together 
                              by complementary base pair binding by hydrogen bonding.  Once the CAS9 is loaded with the complete guide 
                              RNA, it will go and find any DNA that has the matching protospacer for the loaded guide. The guide is a complete 
                              complementary sequence of RNA that matches that protospacer in the Viral genome.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The actual guide sequence is about 20 nucleotides long. Once it finds the matching viral DNA, the 
                              CAS9 enzyme will cut that DNA. This destroys the viral DNA.  I know what you are thinking. If the DNA 
                              sequence copied into the CRISPR region of the Bacteria matches the viral DNA, how does the CAS9 not 
                              cut up that bacteria's DNA too? The answer to that is the PAM sequence of the CAS9 enzyme. This stands 
                              for Protospacer Adjacent Motif. This is a small segment of nucleotides in the DNA that is recognized 
                              by the CAS9 enzyme which is N-G-G. The N stands for any nucleotide while the G stands for Guanine. This 
                              basically means the CAS9 enzyme not only needs to match the guide RNA sequence to the protospacer, but 
                              it also needs to match its PAM to the 2 Guanines near the protospacer. If both don't exist, the CAS9 
                              will not cut. As you can guess, the CRISPR region of the bacteria genome would not contain the PAM 
                              sequence so the CAS9 would be selective for targeting the viral DNA, but not the bacteria's DNA.

                         <p>     
                              The CRISPR system was discovered in 2012 by two scientists by the names of Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle 
                              Charpentier. While studying the CRISPR immune systems of the bacteria Streptococcus Pyogenes, they 
                              discovered a system that could be adapted for human genome editing. CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly 
                              InterSpaced Palindromic Repeats. It turned out this system was the immune system for the bacteria. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The actual CRISPR enzymes that are adapted for human genome editing are called CRISPR Associated 
                              (CAS) Enzymes. The first one discovered was CAS9. These enzymes contain nucleases which are domains 
                              that allow for DNA cutting. The CAS9 has 2 of these nuclease domains to cut both strands of DNA.
                              The CAS9 enzyme is guided by a strand of RNA that matches to the desired sequence in the DNA. 
                              This becomes a search function for finding and cutting the DNA at a specific location. Since the discovery 
                              of the first CAS9 nuclease, scientists and companies have been out there searching the microbe world for 
                              new CRISPR systems and nuclease enzymes. We are going to look at them all.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              CAS enzymes are broken down into two classes with Class 1 enzymes and Class 2 enzymes. These two classes 
                              are further broken down into Types and Subtypes for the CAS enzymes. This gets pretty complicated so I 
                              will give you the general differences. The Class 1 CAS enzymes are made up of multiple units called subunits. 
                              They have to work together to function. One such example is CAS3 which works with CAS8 and CAS11 to 
                              edit RNA. Class 2 CAS enzymes are one large structure that contains everything in one. This includes many of the 
                              current CAS enzymes like CAS9, CASX, CAS12, CAS13 and MAD7. All of these come from different microbes but 
                              work similarly.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All of them contain the RuvC nuclease domain to cut the DNA or RNA. The CAS9 is the only one I know that 
                              also contains the NHN nuclease domain as a second nuclease. CAS enzymes are further broken down into what their nuclease cuts. 
                              Some of them are designed to cut RNA, and they are being built for RNA editing like CAS13. Most are designed for 
                              DNA editing like CAS9, CAS12, MAD7 and CASX.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The major advance in CAS enzyme was the discovery of other CAS enzyme in other microbes. There has been an 
                              explosion of new CAS enzymes that we can use to develop editing tools. CAS9 was the original discovered in Streptococcus 
                              Pyogenes. Not long after Cpf1 (now known as CAS12) was discovered in 2015. This quickly grew in popularity. 
                              Then came the discovery of CASX in E-coli from Berkeley  which is now used by Scribe Therapeutics. MAD7 was discovered in a 
                              bacteria in Madagascar which gave it the name MAD7. It is now used by Inscripta, and they license it to 
                              many companies. This works very much like CAS12 in its function. Both CAS14 and CAS-Phi were discovered by Mammoth Bioscience 
                              and are being developed by them. These are much smaller versions of the CAS enzymes. I call them the CAS 
                              mini. Both of them are about half the size of CAS9. CAS13 is the first RNA editor being developed by the Zhang lab. It was discovered 
                              from a bacteria called Leptotrichia wadei. The last one is CAS11 which is part of the CAS3 system. It is 
                              being develop for applications in gene knockout and possibly RNA editing.
