                         <p>
                              Biology is the study of life and living things. Since all living things are made up of atoms, 
                              chemistry is the first science that goes into understanding biology. I would recommend everyone learn 
                              about chemistry to build a foundation for biology. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first thing we have to look at in biology is, what is a living thing? How do we classify what 
                              is alive and what isn't? We would all agree that a flower or a rabbit is alive while a stone or gold 
                              bar is not. Some things are not that easy. Is a virus really alive?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Cell Theory is the basic theory for biology. There are two principles to cell theory. The first is that 
                              all living things are made up of cells. The cell is the smallest unit of life. The second is that all 
                              life comes from cells. New life comes from existing cells. We know that a stone does not have cells so 
                              it is not alive. A tree is made up of cells so it is alive. When a new tree is made, it comes from the 
                              existing cells of the parent tree. This is done by creating seeds and pollen. Just as humans make eggs 
                              and sperm which are cells that carry the genetic information of the parents. They come together to 
                              create a cell containing the genetic information of both parents that grows into a whole new life. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All living things will have a few attributes that identify them as alive. Different courses will list 
                              these differently, but we will look at the key attributes of life.
                              The first attribute is living things will reproduce. At one time, people believed life was spontaneously 
                              created, but now we know each cell will come from other cells. All cells have the ability to pass their 
                              genetic information to their offspring. The ability of a cell to copy and transmit its genetic 
                              information is a key attribute of living things. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All living things have the ability to grow and develop. They will develop through different stages of 
                              life. This requires them to take in some type of nutrition or energy that allows them to run cell 
                              processes. Even a simple bacteria needs to take in energy and resources to grow and divide from one 
                              cell into two. Plants take in sunlight, water and carbon dioxide while animals take in plants, water 
                              and oxygen to gain nutrients to grow and develop.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All living things need to expend energy to keep themselves in a good state of repair. The theory of 
                              entropy suggests that all things will tend toward a state of decay and disrepair. If you don't keep 
                              up your car or house, they break down and fall apart. In the same way, all living things take in energy 
                              and use it to keep themselves in good condition. 
                              Living things will try to regulate their internal systems to keep all things in balance. The human body 
                              has controls to balance out every system. The cells themselves will keep things in homeostasis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All cells will also respond to external stimuli. Human cells have a system of signals and receptors 
                              that allow them to send and receive communications between them. One cell can also respond to the 
                              signals of another cell. Plant cells can respond to stimuli like sunlight. This can easily be seen by 
                              a plant that grows in the direction of sunlight. The plant cells can sense the light, and they grow 
                              toward it.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Living things will adapt and evolve to their environments. The genetics of living things tells us all 
                              living organisms will suffer mutations in their genetics. These mutations can be either good or bad. 
                              This is selected for or against by the environment of that organism. Adaptation and Evolution go 
                              together. The mutations which provide a survival or reproduction benefit will allow for more and better 
                              adapted offspring. Those that are bad mutations will be selected against. This is the concept of Natural 
                              Selection.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Now that we understand some of the key elements of life, we can see how some things, like a virus, could 
                              be controversial. It has no aspects of life when it's outside the cell, but when it's inside a cell, 
                              it takes on all the attributes of a living organism. Outside a cell, it can not reproduce, adapt, 
                              evolve, grow, or consume energy. Inside a cell, it does all these things. 
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              The human body is made up of organs and each organ has a specific role in the larger organism. We have a 
                              heart to circulate blood, lungs to take in oxygen and stomach to digest food. In the same way the body 
                              has organs, the cells have organelles which are small parts of the cells with a specific function. Many 
                              if not all these organelles will be found in cells.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Membrane is the first key structure of the cell. This is a lipid bilayer of phospholipids that 
                              surrounds the cell to keep the watery stuff inside separated from the watery stuff outside the cell. 
                              Nothing gets into or out of the cell unless it gets across the membrane. The membrane acts like a 
                              border between the inside of the cell and the outside environment. It has a host of receptors, adhesion 
                              molecules and channels that regulate everything that moves into and out of the cell.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The nucleus lies at the center of the cell. It contains all the genetic information of the cell that 
                              is used as a blueprint for everything the cell does. That makes the genetic information very important 
                              so it needs to be protected. The nucleus does this with another lipid membrane surrounding it. That 
                              allows the nucleus to regulate what can go into or out. There are sets of nuclear pores in the 
                              membrane that surround the nucleus that regulate traffic into and out of the nucleus.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The cytoplasm is the watery area between the cell membrane and the nucleus. You might think that this 
                              area would be like a bag of water, but it contains spider web-like structural proteins that give the 
                              cell its form. These structural proteins can also act like a network of roadways for transport proteins 
                              to move things around inside the cytoplasm. The majority of the work that gets done in a cell happens 
                              in the cytoplasm. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The endoplasmic reticulum is a structure that sticks out from the side of the nucleus and looks a lot 
                              like a coral growth. It is broken down into the smooth ER and the rough ER. The rough ER is the part 
                              that is closest to the nucleus. It is rough as it contains the Ribosomes. These are little factories 
                              that take the genetic blueprints from the nucleus and turn into proteins to do work. The rough ER is 
                              like the industrial manufacturing sector of the cell. It is where all the Ribosomes make all the 
                              proteins. There are some Ribosomes that float in the cytoplasm, but they are there for specific 
                              proteins that are needed there. The smooth ER makes the lipids for the cell so that it can make 
                              membranes as it needs them.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Golgi Apparatus or Golgi Body sits in the cytoplasm of the cells and acts like the post office. All 
                              the proteins that are made by the Ribosomes get sent to the Golgi body. Some of these proteins will be 
                              used inside the cells while others will need to be taken to be displayed on the cell surface. Others 
                              will need to be secreted by the cell. The Golgi Body takes these proteins and marks them for delivery 
                              to their proper destination.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Mitochondria is located in the cytoplasm of the cell. It acts at the power plant of the cell. It 
                              takes in sugar and breaks it down to create energy in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) which 
                              the cell uses to power all its functions. The mitochondria has its own DNA. This comes from the mother. 
                              Everyone gets the exact same mitochondrial DNA as their mother. This is because the egg contains a 
                              mitochondria of the mother, but the dad's sperm has nothing but a copy of his genetic information. 
                              The proteins made by the mitochondrial DNA are used for breaking down the sugar. Genetic defects in 
                              this DNA will lead to disorders in making energy from sugar and will be passed from mother to child.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Lysosome takes in the nutrients for the cell in the form of proteins from the food we eat. It breaks 
                              them down into the basic amino acids in the process called catabolism. These basic amino acids can then 
                              be used by the Ribosomes to build new proteins the cell needs in the process called anabolism. 
                         </p>

                              The Proteasome acts like the recycling center of the cell. The cell is constantly making new proteins. 
                              The old proteins need a system to be broken down so the cell can reuse those amino acids to build new 
                              proteins. This is done by the proteasome. When a protein is no longer needed, it will get tagged for 
                              destruction in a process called ubiquitination. Once that protein is tagged for destruction, it will 
                              get loaded into the proteasome and broken down into small fragments of amino acids called peptides. 
                              This part is important in immunology. These peptides can be screened by an immune molecule called MHC. 
                              This will pick up pieces of these peptides and display them on the cell surface. This allows the immune 
                              system to see these self peptides and know all is well inside this cell. When a pathogen invades a cell, 
                              parts of its proteins will get broken down by the proteasome. These will be picked up by the MHC and 
                              taken to the surface. These foreign peptides will be an alarm to the immune cells.
