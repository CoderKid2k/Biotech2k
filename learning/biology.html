                         <p>
                              Biology is the study of life and living things. Since all living things are made up of atoms, 
                              chemistry is the first science that goes into understanding biology. I would recommend everyone learn 
                              about chemistry to build a foundation for biology. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first thing we have to look at in biology is, what is a living thing? How do we classify what 
                              is alive and what isn't? We would all agree that a flower or a rabbit is alive while a stone or gold 
                              bar is not. Some things are not that easy. Is a virus really alive?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Cell Theory is the basic theory for biology. There are two principles to cell theory. The first is that 
                              all living things are made up of cells. The cell is the smallest unit of life. The second is that all 
                              life comes from cells. New life comes from existing cells. We know that a stone does not have cells so 
                              it is not alive. A tree is made up of cells so it is alive. When a new tree is made, it comes from the 
                              existing cells of the parent tree. This is done by creating seeds and pollen. Just as humans make eggs 
                              and sperm which are cells that carry the genetic information of the parents. They come together to 
                              create a cell containing the genetic information of both parents that grows into a whole new life. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All living things will have a few attributes that identify them as alive. Different courses will list 
                              these differently, but we will look at the key attributes of life.
                              The first attribute is living things will reproduce. At one time, people believed life was spontaneously 
                              created, but now we know each cell will come from other cells. All cells have the ability to pass their 
                              genetic information to their offspring. The ability of a cell to copy and transmit its genetic 
                              information is a key attribute of living things. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All living things have the ability to grow and develop. They will develop through different stages of 
                              life. This requires them to take in some type of nutrition or energy that allows them to run cell 
                              processes. Even a simple bacteria needs to take in energy and resources to grow and divide from one 
                              cell into two. Plants take in sunlight, water and carbon dioxide while animals take in plants, water 
                              and oxygen to gain nutrients to grow and develop.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All living things need to expend energy to keep themselves in a good state of repair. The theory of 
                              entropy suggests that all things will tend toward a state of decay and disrepair. If you don't keep 
                              up your car or house, they break down and fall apart. In the same way, all living things take in energy 
                              and use it to keep themselves in good condition. 
                              Living things will try to regulate their internal systems to keep all things in balance. The human body 
                              has controls to balance out every system. The cells themselves will keep things in homeostasis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All cells will also respond to external stimuli. Human cells have a system of signals and receptors 
                              that allow them to send and receive communications between them. One cell can also respond to the 
                              signals of another cell. Plant cells can respond to stimuli like sunlight. This can easily be seen by 
                              a plant that grows in the direction of sunlight. The plant cells can sense the light, and they grow 
                              toward it.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Living things will adapt and evolve to their environments. The genetics of living things tells us all 
                              living organisms will suffer mutations in their genetics. These mutations can be either good or bad. 
                              This is selected for or against by the environment of that organism. Adaptation and Evolution go 
                              together. The mutations which provide a survival or reproduction benefit will allow for more and better 
                              adapted offspring. Those that are bad mutations will be selected against. This is the concept of Natural 
                              Selection.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Now that we understand some of the key elements of life, we can see how some things, like a virus, could 
                              be controversial. It has no aspects of life when it's outside the cell, but when it's inside a cell, 
                              it takes on all the attributes of a living organism. Outside a cell, it can not reproduce, adapt, 
                              evolve, grow, or consume energy. Inside a cell, it does all these things.
