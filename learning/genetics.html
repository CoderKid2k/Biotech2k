                    <section>
                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="structure">DNA Structure</h2>
                         <p>
                              Both DNA and RNA are made up of the basic components called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is made up of 
                              3 smaller parts. There is the nucleic acid often called the base, the ribose sugar and then the 
                              phosphate group. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first part is the base which is made up of the 5 basic nucleic acids with Adenine, 
                              Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine and Uracil. There are a few attributes of nucleic acids for us to cover. The 
                              first thing about the 5 nucleic acids is they are made of Nitrogenous bases. All other structures we see 
                              in biology are made from carbon structures. The nucleic acids are made up of nitrogen. That makes them 
                              unique from other chemical structures. The next thing you will notice is some of these has 2 rings and
                              the others have a single ring structure. The Adenine and Guanine have 2 rings and we call these the 
                              Purines. The Cytosine, Thymine and Uracil all have a single ring. We call them the Pyrimidines.  There are
                              a total of 5 nucleic acids but only 4 get used in DNA and 4 get used in RNA. The Adenine, Guanine and 
                              Cytosine are used in both DNA and RNA. The major difference is that Thymine is used and DNA and Uracil 
                              replaces it in the RNA. If you look at the Thymine vs Uracil, they are actually very similar structures. 
                              The Thymine has an extra Methane group. This is the main difference between Thymine in DNA and Uracil in 
                              RNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              One major difference I want to point out will be important later when we talk about base editing. 
                              Base Editing uses and enzyme called a Deaminase. This enzyme plucks off the Amino group of a nucleic 
                              acid. And amino group is an NH grouping. The Adenine only differs from Guanine by a lone NH2 group 
                              (amino group) at the top. If you pluck that off with a deaminase, you can facilitate the transition 
                              to a Guanine. The same applies to the Cytosine amino group that can be removed to transition to a Thymine. 
                              This is a concept I wanted to touch on in the structure section as we cover Base Editing later.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next part of the Nucleotide will be the Ribose sugar. The ribose sugar comes with 5 carbons in its 
                              structure. The carbon actually look like a Big Dipper formation. Its held into a pentagon shape my a 
                              lone oxygen at the top center. When dealing with a carbon structure like ribose, we number the carbons 
                              using the Prime designation which is represented with an '. So the 1 prime carbon (1') is the first 
                              carbon on the far right that the nucleic acid binds to. The 2' carbon is where we determine Ribose from 
                              Deoxyribose. The ribose has the hydroxyl (OH) group which makes it ribose. When the OH group is replaced
                              with just a hydrogen, that is the Deoxyribose. The Deoxyribose is used in DNA as that OH group would interfere 
                              with the bonding of the base pairs in DNA. The last part of the Nucleotide is the Phosphate group.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The phosphate group is actually a charged molecule that wants to bind to  another molecule 
                              because it carries a negative charge. The phosphate group binds to the 5' carbon. This leaves 
                              only the 3' and 2' carbons not used. Then it bonds again to the 3' carbon of the pervious nucleotide. 
                              This creates a linker of phophates from the 5' of one base to the 3' of the next base.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This basic formation is the basic repetitive group of DNA or RNA. The phosphate group binds to the 5' 
                              carbon of the ribose sugar then it will bind again to the 3' carbon of the previous nucleotide in the 
                              DNA structure. This binding of the phosphate group from the 5' carbon of one nucleotide to the 3' carbon 
                              of the previous nucleotide strings the nucleotide together into a long strand of DNA. This is how we number
                              the DNA as it is read from 5' to 3' along that strand of DNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              We know that DNA is made up of 2 strands. The first strand will run 5' to 3' while the other 
                              strand will run from 3' to 5' creating an exact opposite copy of the first strand. We call this 
                              antiparallel. This brings us to the concept of base paring of the nucleic acids in the double stranded 
                              DNA structure. This is called the Chargaff's rule. He measured the amounts of each nucleic acid used in 
                              the DNA and found that the amount of Adenine was always equal to the Thymine. While the amount of Guanine
                              was always equal to the amount of Thymine. This led to the conclusion that Adenine based paired with 
                              Thymine and Guanine base paired with Cytosine. One purine with one pyrimidine.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Adenine base pairs with Thymine using 2 hydrogen bonds while the Guanine base pairs with the Thymine 
                              using 3 hydrogen bonds. This hydrogen bonding establishes a weak bond that can be opened when enzymes want 
                              to copy or replicate the DNA. The base pairing of the DNA with one strand running in one direction and the 
                              other strand running in the opposite direction gives us the double helix structure of the DNA. This is the 
                              double stranded DNA structure we associate with Human DNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The nucleic acids face the inside of the structure as they are electrostatically 
                              charged and bind to each other. The phosphates are on the outside and make up the 
                              phosphate backbone of the DNA double helix. This is because the phosphate will protect the DNA from the 
                              watery environment around it. When it comes to RNA, its structure is single stranded so it tends to fold 
                              up and base pair with matching nucleic acids forming Stem and Loop formations.
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="package">DNA Packaging</h2>
                         <p>
                              Now that we covered the basic structure of the DNA with nucleotides, base pairing, anti 
                              parallel and double stranding of the DNA. Next we want to look at the double Helix of the 
                              DNA and how DNA is packaged.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              As the DNA is strung together into its base paired double stranded structure it begins to coil around. 
                              Each one of these twists in the DNA is about 10 nucleotides long. This twisting formation of the double stranded 
                              DNA structure creates 2 groves in the structure called the Minor Groove and the Major Groove. This can be 
                              important in some DNA concepts so understand the 2 different grooves.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The overall DNA strand will have a slight negative charge. We will begin to look at the basic component 
                              of DNA packaging called the Nucleosome. This is made up of a Histone protein and the DNA that gets 
                              wrapped around it. The full nucleosome includes the Histone and all the DNA wrapped around it including 
                              the DNA that links to the next nucleosome in the sequence.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The histone itself is made up of 4 basic proteins called H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. The Histone brings 
                              together each of these 4 proteins to make a circular structure that the DNA can wrap around. A complete histone 
                              is 2 of these wheel like structures called an octamer. That allows the DNA to wrap twice around each histone octamer
                              with it wrapping once around each set of histone proteins once. The histone octamer has a slight positive charge 
                              that allows it to bind to the slightly negatively charged DNA and create stable binding. The histone is a 
                              very important part of DNA packaging and Epigenetic regulation of genes. When the DNA is packaged on the histone, it is 
                              inactive as no enzymes that interact with the DNA can gain access to the DNA while its packaged. The 
                              Histones block the binding of these enzymes. This is how cells can regulate which genes are active 
                              (unpackaged) and which ones are inactive (packaged). Only when DNA is unpackaged can it be accessed for 
                              transcription.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The vast majority of DNA in a cell will be packaged on the histones as it won't be necessary for that 
                              specific cell. On the histone proteins, there will be small protein tails. These tails are extremely 
                              important in gene regulation and expression. The histone tails control which genes get unpackaged from the histone 
                              and which do not. This is done by adding or removing Acetyl groups to the histone tails. When acetyl groups 
                              are added, the DNA will bind to the histone preventing gene activation. When the acetyl groups are removed, the histones 
                              will come off the DNA exposing it for transcription. There is a set of enzymes responsible for adding and 
                              removing the acetyl groups on the histone tails to regulate the packaging and unpackaging of the DNA for 
                              transcription. These enzymes are called Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes that add the acetyl 
                              groups and Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes that remove the acetyl groups.

                         <p>
                              The nucleosome is made when the DNA is wrapped twice around the 2 sets of histone proteins that make up 
                              the overall histone protein octamer. The nucleosome also includes the strand of linker DNA that spans to 
                              the next nucleosome in the sequence. This creates a string of beads like structure from the double stranded
                              DNA. This is the first level of packaging called the 11 nanometer (nm). The next level of packaging is 
                              called the 30 nm level. The 30 nm level of packaging requires the H1 histone protein which acts like a spacer 
                              to bring the histones together into a tight formation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next level of DNA packaging is the 300 nm level of packaging. This uses a DNA structural protein and 
                              folds the DNA into loops down the side of the protein. The next level of DNA packaging is the 700 nm level of 
                              packaging. This takes the 300 nm that is looped down the side of the structural protein. It then 
                              wraps that structural protein into another coil further compressing it. The final stage of packaging is that of 
                              the 1400 nm. This is the fully compressed DNA into the common chromosome structure we often associate with 
                              DNA. This level of packaging is only done when the DNA condenses during the cell cycle when it compresses 
                              to undergo mitosis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When DNA is densly packaged it is called heterochromatin. When its loosely packaged, its called 
                              euchromatin. Euchromatin is transcriptionally active. Most of the time, the DNA is in the euchromatin state 
                              because it is actively being used. The heterochramtin is more densly packed and not transcriptionally active.
                              Some parts of the chromosome are always densly packed like around the centromere and the telomeres. These spaces 
                              contain no active genes as they are never active.

                         <p>
                              The human genome is over 3 billion bases long in the DNA. This would be an unbelievably long strand of 
                              DNA. The human genome makes it more manageable by braking it up into 23 chromosomes. Each chromosome 
                              contains specific parts of the overall genetic information. The first chromosomes are the largest and 
                              contain the most genes. As we go through the chromosomes, they get smaller and smaller except the last 
                              one. The first 22 are called the autosomes. They contain the exact same genes on each of these chromosomes.
                              The last set of chromosomes are called the sex chromosomes and it determines the sex of the child. Each 
                              person gets 23 chromosomes from their mom and another 23 chromosomes from their dad for a set of 23 with 
                              46 chomosomes in total. If the 23rd chromosomes are both an X chromosome, the child is female. If there is an X and a Y 
                              chromosome for this set, the child will be male. The very last set of chromosomes actually determines 
                              sex in human genetics. This is because the Y chromosome carries the genes that determine male characteristics.

                              The term ploidy is used in genetics to represent how many copies of each chromosome each species has. If a 
                              cell has only 1 copy of each chromosome, like our germline cells, that is haploid. Often shown as (N). If a cell has 2 
                              copies of each chromosome, like our somatic cells, its called diploid (2N). Some species have more chromosomes.
                              The strawberry is octoploid with 8 copies of each chromosome. The understanding of the chromosomes, their 
                              structure and copy number is important in human disease. There can be chromosomal defects that can occur in 
                              the shape or even number of chromosomes. When cells end up with a wrong number in a specific chromosome, 
                              we call that aneuploidy. The typical cell gets 2 copies of each chromosome in humans. The term Monosomy 
                              means each cell only gets a single copy of a specific chromosome. Tuner Syndrome is an example of a monosomy 
                              disorder where the person gets only 1 copy of the X chromosome. Trisomy occurs when a person gets 3 copies 
                              of a specific chromosome. There are a few disorders that stem from a trisomy of a specific chromosome. The most 
                              commonly known is Trisomy 21 which leads to Down Syndrome. The number of chromosomes can change in specific 
                              cells during cancer genomic instability.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Cancer can also lead to rearrangements of the chromosomes. These are called translocations. It occurs 
                              when a part of 1 or more chromosomes is cut off an placed on another chromosome. These can be reciprocal 
                              or nonreciprocal translocations. One of the most famous translocations in cancer is called the Philadelphia 
                              Chromosome. Its a reciprocal translocation where part of the 9 and 22 chromosome swap a section of their 
                              DNA.

                         <p>
                              The next concept for chromosomes is the location of their Centromere. The centromere is a key part of 
                              the chromosome that plays a role in binding proteins to segregate the chromosomes during cell 
                              replication. There are 4 types of centromeres and they are named by their location in the chromosome. 
                              If the centromere is right in the center, its called metacentric. If its slightly off center, it is called 
                              sub metacentric. If the centromere is closer to the end of the chromosome, then its acrocentric. If its at 
                              the very end of the centromere, then its telocentric. There are no natural telocentric human chromosomes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              You sometimes hear the term that a gene is located on the short or long arm of the chromosome. this refers 
                              to the smaller part of an acrocentric chromosome. The long arm would be the longer part of the acrocentric 
                              chromosome.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last part of the chromosome is the Telomere. This is the cap on the ends of each chromosome. It 
                              plays a key role in cell division. The telomere is there to protect the ends of the DNA strands.  Each time 
                              a cell copies its DNA for mitosis, the telomere gets a little shorter. This is called the Hayflick  limit 
                              and averages 40 to 60 times a cell can go through mitosis before it hits this limit. Once any cell hits this 
                              limit it goes into senescence which it will no longer divide. This plays a role in many age related 
                              disorders. Stem cells express the gene for an enzyme that is called telomerase. The telomerase enzyme extends 
                              the telomere each time the cell divides making stem cells immortal. This leads to one of the hallmarks of 
                              cancer. Cancer cells turn on the gene for telomerase enzyme allowing them to become immortal.

                         <p>
                              There are about 3 billion nucleotides in the human genome across 23 pairs of Chromosomes. It would take a very 
                              long time to copy all of the DNA with just one set of replication enzymes. This means the DNA will 
                              synthesize using many points of replication. The site where the replication starts is called the origin of replication. 
                              There is one of these replication start points every several thousand nucleotides in the human genome. 
                              These are at sites rich with A and T pairs as they have less bonds which makes it easier for the replication
                              enzymes to open up the DNA and get started.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first enzyme will be Helicase which opens the DNA at the origin of replication. It unzips the DNA along the 
                              hydrogen bonds that hold the DNA together. The spot at which the Helicase unzips the DNA is called the 
                              replication fork. Since the DNA has an electrostatic charge, it will want to snap back closed. There is a set 
                              of proteins called Single Strand Binding (SSB) proteins that bind to each strand of the DNA and stabilizes 
                              the charges. The DNA polymerase that is responsible for copying the DNA can only bind to double stranded DNA, 
                              but in this case the DNA is separated and each stand is alone. There is a RNA primase that comes in and 
                              lays in a few RNA primers into the starting spot so the DNA polymerase can attach. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Both strands are copied at the same time. Each original strand acts as a template while a new strand is 
                              synthesized from each of the original strands. This process leaves each new DNA with 1 original strand 
                              bound to 1 new strand. This process of taking one original strand and using it as a template to make a new 
                              strand leaves each new copy of the DNA with one original paired with one new strand. This is called the 
                              Semiconservative model of DNA replication.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The DNA polymerase has to read the DNA going from the 3' to the 5' direction because it creates DNA from 
                              5' to 3' direction. This makes one strand of the DNA easy to copy. The polymerase just binds to the 3' end 
                              and goes copying the DNA along the way as it is always moving forward. The stand that starts at the 3' 
                              end and continues with the flow of the replication fork is called the Leading Strand. The DNA polymerase 
                              just moves along this strand copying the template strand into a new strand as it goes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The other strand runs in the opposite direction of this leading strand. That mean the DNA polymerase has to
                              work backward as that strand is going in the 5' to 3' direction. It does this by jumping several thousand 
                              nucleotides ahead and working backwards. These sections of DNA, it copies by jumping ahead and working backwards, are 
                              called Okazaki fragments. Initially, they are not connected together. There is another enzyme that comes 
                              along and connects these Okazaki fragment together. This enzyme is called DNA ligase.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Because the DNA is wound together into a double helix, the unwinding of the DNA causes tension on the DNA.
                              If that tension isn't released, it will build until it stops the helicase. There is another enzyme that binds to 
                              the double strands of DNA ahead of the helicase enzyme. As the tension on the DNA gets too high, the 
                              topoisomerase enzyme will break the bonds of the DNA and allow it to unwind the tension before binding it 
                              back together. The topoisomerase is a critical enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis to release the 
                              tension. There are cancer drugs that target this topoisomerase enzyme to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly 
                              replicating cells. This causes the DNA to break from the tension and the cells undergo cell death.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The process of DNA synthesis occurs during the cell cycle in the S phase of the cycle. This
                              is the only time the DNA gets copied before the cell undergoes mitosis or mieosis.

                              The DNA of the cell serves as a master blue print. Every cell of our body has a complete copy of this DNA 
                              blueprint. Depending on the cell and its functions, it will use specific parts of the blueprint found in 
                              the DNA to produce the proteins and enzymes needed by that cell. The rule is that each gene contains all the 
                              DNA to create one fully functional protein or enzyme. The Central Dogma of Biology states that DNA creates 
                              RNA which creates proteins.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The gene itself has a few key regions that are important to be familiar with. The very first nucleotide to be 
                              copied is the start of the actual gene. The part that of the DNA that gets copied is called the Open Reading 
                              Frame (ORF). The gene includes all the nucleotides that make up the actual messenger RNA. The next important 
                              part about the DNA is the promoter. The promoter starts about 50 to 100 nucleotides before the gene starting
                              nucleotide. The most basic part of the promoter is called the TATA box. Its a sequence of Thymine and Adenine 
                              nucleotides. The transcription factors will bind to the promoter region and build the initiation complex 
                              for gene transcription on the TATA box. There is actually a big complex of proteins that must bind to the promoter 
                              region before the RNA polymerase. This is called the initiation complex. It starts with the TATA binding 
                              protein (TBP) and builds this complex that recruits RNA polymerase.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The RNA Polymerase II enzyme will bind to the Initiation Complex and begin copying the gene starting 
                              with the first start nucleotide and proceeds till it reaches the termination point. Then the RNA 
                              Pol II will fall off and the primary transcript will be finished. 
                         </p>

                              The next important part of a gene is the regulatory regions. These are located located thousands of bases 
                              before the promoter region. This is because the DNA will flip over and the regulatory region will make 
                              contact with the promoter. The regulatory region can bind transcription factors called Repressors or Enhancers. 
                              The DNA will fold in a loop which allows these Repressors or Enhancers to come in contact with the promoter.
                              This will allow the Repressor to block binding of the RNA polymerase. An Enhancer can bind to the regulatory
                              region too. It will make contact 
                              with the RNA polymerase, but it will increase the activity of the RNA polymerase leading to increased gene 
                              expression. Once the transcription factors have bound to the promoter region, the RNA polymerase can bind to the
                              transcription factors and begin copying the gene if there is no repressor on the regulatory element. 
                              It can also be increased by an enhancer.

                              The RNA polymerase opens up the DNA itself as it binds to the initiation complex. It doesn't need any 
                              assistance like the DNA polymerase did. It will begin copying the DNA using one strand of DNA as a 
                              template and create a RNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction. The RNA polymerase must use the same rules 
                              as the DNA polymerase. It reads the DNA from 3' to the 5' direction so it can create the RNA in the 
                              5' to 3' direction.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The initial strand of the RNA is called the primary transcript. It will undergo three modifications before
                              it can leave the nucleus of the cell. The first is it will undergo splicing by the spliceosome complex. The 
                              vast majority of the gene is made up of non coding information called introns. The actual coding part of 
                              the gene is called the exons. The spliceosome will follow splicing marks on the primary RNA and 
                              remove all the introns and paste the exons back together. This also leads to the ability of alternative
                              splicing by cells to use a gene differently. One cell might use Exons 1, 2, 4, and 5 while another might
                              use Exons 1, 3, 4 and 5. That is the concept of alternative splicing.
                              There are about 22,000 genes, but we know there are over 100,000 proteins in the human body. Most of this 
                              variation is done by alternative splicing. Different cells will use different splicing to create different 
                              variants of a protein.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              After the splicing of the RNA is complete, there are enzymes that will add a Guanine cap to the 5' end
                              of the RNA. This serves to allow the RNA to exit the nucleus and assists in loading the RNA into the
                              Ribosome. The last process is the addition of the poly A tail. This just adds about 250 or more Adenine
                              nucleotides to the end of the RNA. This signifies the end of the RNA when its read by the Ribosome.

                         <p>
                              The final RNA product is now called a messenger RNA (mRNA). Its built to take the DNA information
                              and deliver it to the Ribosome for production of a protein. The concept of a fully processed mRNA is 
                              important.  In Virology, you will see many RNA based viruses. You might think, since it is RNA, it can 
                              go right into the cell and start making proteins. That isn't always true. Many of them are not properly 
                              formatted into the mRNA format necessary to load into the Ribosome.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When a strand of DNA or RNA runs in the 5' to 3' direction, we call that the positive or sense strand.
                              When it rund is the opposite direction from 3' to 5' direction, we call that a negative or Antisense
                              strand. The messenger RNA that is created by transcription is positive or sense strand. Many virues are
                              negative strand or antisense. They have to be translated into the opposite form before they can be used 
                              by the Ribosomes.

                              When the messenger RNA (mRNA) exits the nucleus, it will be loaded into a organelle called the ribosome. 
                              These little factories take the RNA blueprint and use it to build a protein from amino acids. This is where 
                              capping of the 5' end of the mRNA becomes important. That Guanine cap is designed to help the mRNA load into 
                              the Ribosome for translation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Here we introduce the concept of the Codon. The DNA is made up of 4 bases with Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine 
                              and Thymine. They have to encode 20 different amino acids. To do so, the DNA uses a codon. Its a 
                              combination of 3 nucleotides. The DNA only contains 4 basic bases, but it has to code at least 20 amino acids. 
                              This only works with at least 3 bases making up a single codon to encode an amino acids. If you look at the 
                              math, 4*4*4 = 64 possible combinations. There are only 20 amino acids. This leads to many of the combinations 
                              coding the same amino acid. This level of redundancy in the code allows for some variation without bad 
                              effects.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The start codon is always AUG (Adenine, Uracil and Guanine) and codes for the amino acid Methionine. Each 
                              3 bases of nucleotides is one codon and encodes one amino acid until it reaches the stop codon. There are 
                              actually 3 different stop codons with UAA, UAG and UGA. The Ribosome takes the RNA and begins with coding the 
                              start codon with Methionine and continues to read each and every codon until it reaches the stop codon. It 
                              will use transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to build a chain of amino acids from the mRNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Transfer RNA (tRNA) has an anticodon on one end and the amino acid on the other end. The tRNA will 
                              match the mRNA codon with its equal opposite anticodon. When it finds a match, it will add its amino acid 
                              to the chain of amino acids being built. The Ribosome will continue to progress along the mRNA template 
                              matching the anticodons of the tRNA to the codons of the mRNA. It will add the amino acids to the chain of 
                              amino acids its building until it reaches the stop codon.

                              Mutations in the DNA can cause some very serious damage to the final product which is the protein. Since 
                              3 nucleotides come together to make one codon and produce one amino acid, you can get some dramatic 
                              changes from even a single nucleotide mutation. These changes in the DNA can be called Point Mutations or Single 
                              Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). The big difference to which term we use is the result. We typically use 
                              SNP when its a benign mutation. Point mutation tends to be used when change in the DNA causes disease. Point 
                              mutations can come in two kinds. The first is the kind that does not cause any change. Some changes might just 
                              end up coding the same amino acid. These mutations that lead to no change are called Silent Mutations.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When a single point mutation causes the Ribosome to code a different amino acid, we call these Missense 
                              mutations. These are the mutations that often lead to disease. Sickle Cell disease is one example of a 
                              single nucleotide mutation leading to a changed amino acid. This missense mutation leads to another amino 
                              acid being coded. The two different amino acids can have dramatically different behaviors. Such as, the one 
                              is hydrophobic while the other is hydrophilic. That simple change will change the entire shape of the protein. 
                              In proteins, shape determines function. When you change the shape of the protein due to the change of a 
                              single amino acid, you can end up with a dramatically different protein in function.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next type of point mutation is the nonsense mutation. This is where a mutation changes the codon from 
                              encoding an amino acid to a stop codon. This terminates the production of the protein early. A nonsense mutation 
                              will make a truncated version of the protein. In some cases, the shorter proteins are still functional or 
                              partially functional. In many cases, they lose complete function of that protein.  The insertion of a stop codon 
                              into a gene has actually become a tool used today in gene editing to insert a stop codon early into the 
                              gene sequence which acts like a gene suppression.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last mutation is called the frame shift mutation. That is when a single nucleotide gets inserted or 
                              deleted (Indel). That causes every codon in that gene to get shifted. None of the codons will be right 
                              when they all get shifted by one extra or one less nucleotide. These mutations tend to happen from errors
                              in DNA synthesis where the polymerase slips or skips a base. It is also a big concern when DNA has a Double 
                              Stranded Break. The repair machinery can add or remove bases during the repair.

                         <p>
                              The ribosome creates the initial peptide of amino acids. It starts out as just a single long stand of amino 
                              acids. Then the peptide will undergo folding. There are various proteins and enzymes that assist in the protein 
                              folding process. There are 4 stages to protein folding with the Primary structure which is just the stating peptide. 
                              Then there is the secondary structures like alpha helixes and beta pleated sheets. Then comes the Tertiary 
                              structure which is the final 3D protein. Some proteins will combine together to form what is called a Quaternary structure. 
                              These tend to be multi protein structures like Hemoglobin and Antibodies. The folding of a protein is 
                              regulated by the many electrostatic and hydrostatic bonds of the amino acids.
                              Some of the Amino Acids with have electrostatic bonds and will want to fold and bind to each other. Others 
                              will have hydrophobic properties which will make them turn into the center of the protein while hydrophilic 
                              amino acids turn outward toward the watery environment.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first structure is the starting Primary Structure. This primary structure is just the sequence of amino acids 
                              and their place in the overall chain. This often just looks like string of beads. The Secondary structures will form into 
                              alpha helix and beta pleated sheets. The alpha helix is just a coil shape and these play a huge role in 
                              many protein structures. The part of a protein that spans across the membrane of a cell will be an alpha 
                              helix in many cases. The alpha helix has about 3.6 amino acids per turn. They are often held together by the bonds between 
                              amino acids. This isn't the only helix as there is a phi helix out there with 4.1 amino acids per turn. 
                              The alpha helix is used over and over in proteins. The alpha helix even makes up the binding regions of antibodies 
                              and T cell receptors. Its a critical sturcture to understand in biology.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The beta pleated sheet looks like a radiator structure where the strands alternate back and forth to make a 
                              sheet like structure. The different amino acids in these structures will bind to each other firming up the overall 
                              structure. These are key structures in many proteins.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Tertiary Structure is the final 3 dimensional shape of the protein. You will hear them called globulins which 
                              means protein. The final structure of the protein will determine its function. When it comes to proteins, shape 
                              determines function. This is a very important concept as a single change in a single base can code a different 
                              amino acid. That can completely change the shape of the protein and ultimately its function. A fully folded protein 
                              will have both Alpha helexes and Beta Pleated sheets. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Quaternary structure is when multiple proteins come together to form a larger structure like in 
                              Immunoglobulins or Hemoglobin. In these structures several proteins are coming together to build a larger 
                              protein structure that functions as one. Typically, the individual proteins in a quaternary structures are 
                              called chains. When we talk about an antibody, we talk about the heavy chain and light chain. They are separate 
                              proteins that are part of a larger protein structure.

                         <p>
                              Most cells spend their lives in the G0 phase of growth. This means they are fully mature and go about 
                              their normal functions. They do not replicate often or at all, but some cells are created frequently 
                              like red blood cells and neutrophils. Different cells of the body will have different turn over rates 
                              at which they replicate. Cells like the eye or heart cells don't ever go through mitosis. Others will 
                              only enter mitosis after injury or damage. Some cells turn over very often like cells of the GI tract.
                              The process of cell growth is highly controlled and regulated as Cancer is the process of uncontrolled 
                              cell growth. When a cell gets the right growth signals, it will enter the Cell Cycle. This begins mitosis 
                              which is the regulated splitting of 1 cell into 2.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When a cell gets the signal to replicate, it will go from G0 phase into G1 phase. This is called the 
                              growth or gap phase. In G1 phase of cell growth, the cell will build up resources and grow so that it is 
                              ready to split in two. It will duplicate all its organelles in preperation for division. After reaching the 
                              end of the G1 phase, there is a checkpoint for the cell. Its called the G1 to S phase checkpoint. This is 
                              where all the DNA is inspected to ensure its good before it gets copied. If it passes this checkpoint, 
                              it moves into S phase. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Then it moves into S phase which stands for Synthesis. That is where the DNA gets 
                              synthesized so that every chromosome is copied. Once the cell has 2 copies of every chromosome called 
                              sister chromatids, it will advance into G2 phase of growth.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              In G2 phase it will check all the DNA and verify there are no errors, and the cell will be ready to divide. 
                              Once all the DNA has been checked to ensure no errors, it will face another checkpoint at the end of the 
                              G2 phase. The entire cycle up this point from G1 to S phase to the end of G2 is called "Interphase". 
                              When its complete, thre is one last checkpoint called the G2 to M phase checkpoint. This ensures everything is 
                              ready to begin the process of dividing up all the DNA, organelles and splitting the cells.  When its all 
                              complete, the cell advances into the final M phase which stand for Mitosis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The process of Mitosis is 5 steps with Prophase, Prometaphase, Metaphase, Anaphase and Telophase.
                              The first step in mitosis is called Prophase. In this phase, the centrosomes form and move to 
                              opposite sides of the cell and begin to produce protein strands called tubulin. The cell will enter 
                              Prometaphase of mitosis where the nucleus of the cell will dissolve. Then the Tubulin strands will bind 
                              from each centrosome to each of the centromeres of the Chromosomes. During Metaphase, the tubulins will 
                              bind to each and every chromosome and pull them tight. Since both centromeres are pulling on every 
                              chromosome, this puts tension on them and lines them up at the center of the cell. This line up is called 
                              the Metaphase Plate. In anaphase the enzyme separase will go down the line and cut the proteins that hold 
                              the sister chromatids together allowing the tension of the centromeres to pull apart the chromosome taking 
                              1 copy to each side. Then the cell will undergo cytokinesis which is the actual splitting of the cells into 
                              two. Each new cell will then form a new nucleus around its DNA completing the cycle of mitosis.

                         <p>
                              Epigenetics means on top of genetics. The study of Genetics is all about the DNA. Its about how its 
                              structured and packaged. Epigenetics is about how Genes are expressed and regulated. We are born with 
                              our Genetics, but our Epigenetics is acquired by experiences and environmental exposure. I don't want 
                              to get too deep into epigenetics, but I think there are a few concepts that are important to understand.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first one is the process of gene methylation and gene silencing. Each gene has a promoter in front 
                              of the gene where the transcription factors bind and activate transcription of that gene. The promoter of 
                              the gene will often have Cytosine and Guanine rich regions called CpG islands. That stands for Cytosine, 
                              Phosphate, and Guanine. These CpG rich regions can become methylated. Methylation of these CpG regions of 
                              the promoter can come from environmental factors like UV exposure, chemicals, radiation, smoking and so 
                              many other things. This exposure can cause the methylation of the promoter and eventual silencing of the 
                              gene. The silencing of a gene plays a big role in understanding tumor genesis in cancer. The loss of tumor 
                              suppressor genes don't always come from a mutation of the DNA which renders them ineffective. It will often 
                              come from gene silencing by epigenetic forces.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The second concept of epigenetics is the Acetylation and Deacetylation of the Histones which package the DNA. 
                              I mentioned these enzymes before in DNA packaging. We learned in the packaging section that the DNA gets wrapped 
                              twice around each histone. While the DNA is packaged like this, it is transcriptionally inactive. The 
                              proteins and enzymes that do transcription can not access packaged genes.  For a gene to be transcribed, it has to
                              be exposed to the transcription machinery. This is controlled by acetylation or deacetylation of the 
                              histones. When the acetyl groups are added the DNA opens up. The DNA normally has a slight negative charge. The histone 
                              has a slight positive charge. They like to electrostatically bond to each other. By adding or removing an 
                              acetyl group to the tails of the histone, the charge can change allowing the DNA to be unwound. This is an important concept 
                              to understand as a gene needs to be exposed to be active. Some areas of the DNA are always inactive and 
                              densely packaged like round the centromere and the telomeres. There is no genes encoded in this region.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              One cell might have a gene active as it uses it all the time while another cell will keep that gene 
                              packaged as it never uses that gene. Each cell only uses genes specific to that cells role and functions.
                              Some oncology drugs will target the acetylation or deacetylation of histones to suppress the transcription 
                              of genes in cancer. Some other oncology drugs will target the demethylation of the DNA to attempt to 
                              remove the suppression of the tumor suppressor gene.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="transmission">Transmission Genetics</h2>
                         <p>
                              Transmission Genetics is all about the study of how genetic information is passed from one generation
                              to the next. It is the study of how DNA gets copied and placed in Gametes for the purpose of reproduction.
                              It is study of the patterns of inheritance of traits from parents to children. With patterns of inheritance, 
                              we study how a genetic disease can be passed from one generation to the next. Transmission genetics comes 
                              with a bunch of terms that we will have to go over. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Our genetic information in encoded in linear segments of DNA called chromosomes. Each chromosome contains 
                              a specific part of the overall genetic information. We get 23 chromosomes from each of our parents for a 
                              total of 46. You get a chromosome 1 from your mother and a chromosome 1 from your father. They encode the 
                              exact same genes, but not exactly the same genetic information. These two same chromosomes are called a 
                              Homologous pair. The homologous pair contains the same genetic information. The first 22 chromosome pairs 
                              are called the autosomes. They are the same for every single person and encode all the same genes. The last 
                              pair (23rd pair) are the sex chromosomes. This determines the sex of the offspring. If both of the 23rd chromosomes 
                              are X chromosomes, the child is female. If it is 1 X and 1 Y chromosome for the 23rd pair, the child is 
                              male. The Y chromosome determines male as it encodes all the genes to drive male characteristics.
                              Males get 1 X and a Y chromosome. When they end up with a defective X chromosome, they have no spare to help 
                              them because the X and Y chromosomes encode different genes. This leads to the some of the genetic 
                              disorders we hear about every day. Since females have 2 X chromosomes, one of them will be deactivated in the 
                              fetus. It happens early in fetal development, and
                              they end up with about 50% of their cells using 1 X chromosome and the other 50% using the other X
                              chromosome. This is called X chromosome inactivation. This is done to keep the gene dosing correct since males 
                              have only 1 X chromosomes and females get 2. One of them gets inactivated in every cell to keep the level 
                              of proteins produced equal in both males and females. The effects of X inactivation can be noticed by the 
                              remnant of the inactivated X chromosome which is called a barr body. They can be noticed in the neutrophils 
                              of the immune system.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Each chromosome has a centromere that is the center of that chromosome. Not all centromeres are at
                              the exact center of the chromosome. It tends to vary with each chromosome. These centromeres play a
                              key role in cell division. This is where the sister chromatids will be linked together after DNA synthesis. 
                              It is also where the tubulin strands from the centrosomes bind to pull apart the sister chromatids during mitosis 
                              and meiosis.

                         <p>
                              The term locus is the location of that specific gene on the chromosome. This of this like the genes address 
                              on that Chromosome. There are some common gene loci that we refer to all the time. We talk abut the different 
                              locations (locus) of genes on different chromosomes. Let us look at a few so you get an idea of how genes 
                              are located on chromosomes. One such example is the T cell receptor alpha chain locus or the TRAC locus. This 
                              is referred to when inserting a CAR receptor into the exact location of the T cell receptor. The gene for 
                              the Alpha T cell receptor is located on chromosome 14. We know right were to look for it. Some other important 
                              locations of genes are: MHC is located on chromosome 6 and the Heavy Chain of antibodies and T cell alpha 
                              chain are both on chromosome 14. The light chains of antibodies are located on chromosome 2 and 22 for the 
                              kappa and lambda light chains respectively. The beta chain of the T cell receptor is located on chromosome 7. 
                              As you can see the locus of a gene is its location on a specific chromosome. You know right were to look 
                              for it.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              An allele is the variation across a population for a specific gene. Each locus will encode the exact 
                              same gene like eye color or hair color, but there can be many different alleles of that gene. You can have 
                              blue eyes, brown eyes, and even green eyes. These are different alleles. This leads us to two other 
                              definitions of genotype and phenotype.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The genotype is the what alleles you actually have at the location of a specific gene. You might have 
                              gotten brown hair allele from mom and the blond hair allele from dad. That makes your genotype 
                              brown/blond. The term phenotype refers to the actual physical expression of that gene. If you had brown hair 
                              gene from mom and blond hair gene from dad, what color hair you have would be your phenotype. That means if
                              you have brown hair that is your phenotype.  So in this example the genotype is Brown/Blond, but the phenotype 
                              ends up being brown. Why does this happen? This brings us to the concept of dominance. Before I jump into 
                              Dominance, I got one other important concept here on genes with homozygous and heterozygous.
                              When both genes have the exact same allele, its called homozygous. When they are different alleles,
                              it is called heterozygous. Homo meaning the same and Hetero meaning different.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The study of dominance in genes is one of the hallmarks of transmission genetics. How some genes are 
                              expressed over others. The principle is a dominant gene gets expressed over a recessive gene. There are 
                              several forms of dominance. The first is complete dominance. That means if you get an allele  for blue eyes 
                              and an allele for brown eyes, the dominant gene would be expressed as the phenotype. Let us assume brown eyes 
                              are dominant over blue so the phenotype would be brown eyes. The blue eye gene is recessive and can be 
                              passed to offspring, but it won't be expressed over the brown eyes. The second is co-dominance. This is best 
                              expressed with the MHC. You get 3 MHC class I antigens from mom and 3 MHC class I antigens from dad. Each 
                              and every cell will express all six of these antigens. No one antigen will be expressed more or less then 
                              the others. Then comes incomplete dominance. This is where the phenotype is a blend of the two genes. This is 
                              best exampled from flowers. If you have a red flower and a white flower and decide to crossbreed them, your result 
                              would be a pink flower in a heterozygous offspring.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next concept we must cover is that of Epistasis. Epistasis is the concept of one gene regulating the 
                              expression of another. The first gene may create pigment for hair color while the other determines how pigment 
                              for hair color gets expressed in the hair. Let us say Gene #1 is either Black or Brown for the allele possibilities. 
                              You can either get Black or Brown hair. Black is dominant over Brown so if you get one of each allele, you 
                              will have Black hair. Now the epistatic gene regulates how much of that pigment gets expressed into the hair. You 
                              can have Gene #2 which expresses the pigment as On or Off as the allele. Even if you have a Black or Brown pigment gene, 
                              if you get a Off gene for expression, you end up being blond. You can produce the pigment, but the epistatic gene 
                              prevents it from being expressed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last concept on dominance will be penetrance. This is how much a gene might be expressed in the 
                              population. This often applies to genes that lead to disease. The basic concept is not every person who gets the gene for a 
                              disease will get the disease. Some diseases are 100%. If you get that gene, you definitely will get the 
                              disease. Other diseases will have only a percentage of people that get the gene develop the disease. The best
                              example here is polydactyly. This is a gene that runs in families where they can get more than 5 fingers or toes. 
                              It only has a penetrace of 43%. That means only 43% of people who get this gene are borne with an extra digit.

                         <p>
                              We will start with a grandparent generation and see how those chromosomes get passed to parents 
                              then to children. This will help demonstrate the way chromosomes gets passed from generation to 
                              generation.  Inheritance patterns follow how chromosomes are passed from parents to children. This is 
                              a cool concept if your trying to figure out if you got blue eyes from grandma or a dimple in your chin 
                              from grandpa, but it becomes very important when studying genetic disorders.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Each of your parents got 46 chromosomes with 23 coming from grandma and 23 coming from grandpa. Those 
                              chromosomes were randomly passed to mom or dad. Your mom and dad are a random collection of both grandma's 
                              and grandpa's chromosomes. Your mom could end up with Grandma's Chromosome 1, 2, and 5 while getting Grandpa's 
                              chromosome 3, 4 and 6. The process of a chromosomes being deposited into any gamete is 50/50. This is 
                              called the law of independent assortment. A person has 2 of each chromosome and each gamete has the same odds 
                              of getting a copy of each, it is only important that the gamete only gets 1 copy. Wether or not it is mom's chomosome 1 
                              or dad's chromosoe 1 does not matter as long as one of each of these chromosome end up in a single gammete.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This random assortment is to promote variation in our species which helps with evolution and survival. This makes each of 
                              your parents 50% grandma and 50% grandpa since they get 1 of each chromosome from each of them. Then those chromosomes from 
                              your mom and dad will then get randomly assorted again and you will end up with 50% of your mom's and 50% 
                              of your dad's chromosomes. You could end up with those blue eyes from grandma and those dimples from 
                              grandpa.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This study of inheritance was developed by Gregor Mendel and is often called Mendellian Genetics instead 
                              of Transmission Genetics. It tracks how these possible combinations of genes from the parents get passed 
                              to the children. Mendel did all his genetic research using pea plants. He laid all the ground work and rules 
                              for the passing of genetic information from one generation to the next.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The monohybrid cross is a tool that allows us to predict the distribution of the gene possibilities. When 
                              we look at a specific gene, we will label all of the possible alleles. For a monohybrid cross, we make a box with 
                              4 squares in it. On left side we put both of mom's genes. Along the top, we place both of dad's genes. Then we 
                              match the left to the top and place the 2 genes into that square. This gives us the 4 possible outcomes of those 
                              genes. We use a letter to represent a gene type like B would be black dominant hair and b would be brown recessive hair. 
                              If mom has genes for Black/Black, she is homozygous dominant. Every block would get at least 1 capital B from mom. 
                              That means every one of her children will have black dominant hair as their phenotype and all will be at least heterozyous 
                              for black hair. If dad has 2 recessive b for brown hair genes, then we place a small b in every square. Quickly, we 
                              can see all their children will end up heterozygous with B/b genotype and black hair for phenotype. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Let us do another example with a monohybrid cross. Let us say mom is heterozygous for B for dominant Brown eyes
                              and b for recessive blue eyes. Dad is heterozyous for B for dominant Brown eyes and b for recessive blue eyes. 
                              This means mom will have B and b on the left side of our 4 squares, and dad will have B and b across the top. The first 
                              square will be a match for BB from mom and dad. The second square will match B from mom with little b from dad.
                              The thrid square will be little b form mom and big B from dad. The last square will be both little b's from both parents.
                              That means 1/4 of the children will be homozygous dominant for B/B. There will be 2/4 or half with heterozygous B/b. The final 
                              1/4 of children will have both b/b for homozygous recessive blue eyes. For phenotypes, 3 out of 4 children have a dominant 
                              gene and will express the dominant brown eyes phenotype.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="gene">Gene Linkage</h2>
                         <p>
                              The rules of Mendelian Genetics treats every gene as if it were on a separate chromosome. Every 
                              gene has a 50% chance of making it into any gamete. The truth is genes are on chromosomes and many genes can be on the 
                              same chromosome. This brings up the concept of gene linkage. One such example is the genes for Major Histocompatibility 
                              Complex (MHC) on Chromosome 6. These genes are linked and you inherit the whole group of them from the same chromosome. 
                              You get 1 chromosome 6 from mom and 1 from dad. You will have the exact same genes for each of these genes as your parents 
                              on that chromosome. These linked genes are called a haplotype. This means that group of genes are all inherited together. This 
                              leads us to the concept then of crossing over. This is a process during meiosis. This is where the sister 
                              chromatids line up and synapse.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              During the process of synapsis, you can get the crossing over of parts of the chromosome for sister 
                              chromatids. This is where parts of mom's chromosome 1 might exchange segments of DNA with dad's 
                              chromosome 1. The rate and locations on chromosome for crossing over is different for each and every 
                              chromosome. Some chromosomes or segments of chromosomes will allow a lot of exchange of DNA while others
                              won't ever have crossing over. Because of this process, the distance between 2 genes plays a role in gene 
                              linkage. The distance between 2 genes is measured in centimorgans (cM). The process of crossing over is 
                              called recombination and its used to measure the distance between two different genes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              By measuring the rate of recombination occurring between 2 genes, we can determine the distance between those 
                              2 genes in centimorgans. There is a whole chapter in transmission genetics on recombination with single 
                              crossing over, double crossing over and triple crossing over of genes. When the distance between 2 genes reaches a 
                              distance more than 50 cM, those 2 genes are considered to be treated as if they were on 2 different 
                              chromosomes. This is because a 50 cM distance equates to a 50% chance of recombination happening between 
                              those 2 genes. That 50% puts them equal to the 50% rule for independent assortment. This process of recombination 
                              and crossing over of DNA between 2 sister chromatids only happens in Meiosis. This does not occur during 
                              mitosis.

                         <p>
                              The pedigree is a diagram that is used to track a trait across a family tree. It might be cool to track 
                              the trait of red hair in your family, the pedigree is critical for tracking a genetic disease through 
                              a family to determine the risk of inheritance. There are some basics to drawing a pedigree. The lines connect lineages 
                              with the males being the squares and the females being the circles. The lines connect 2 mates and show a tree of
                              all their children. The roman numerals on the left mark each of these generations. Some pedigrees will use a slash / 
                              to cross out deceased people in the pedigree.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Anyone who has the trait gets a small colored circle in the center. They carry the gene for the disease, 
                              but they are not affected. Those that have the actual disease get fully colored in. The lines link the children from each 
                              generation and their mates. The children for each set of parents gets listed from left to right in the order of birth.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              By looking at the patterns of inheritance on a pedigree, we can quickly see how the trait is passed. If the 
                              trait affects both males and females, its an autosomal trait. If it only affects males or females, then its 
                              a sex linked disease.  If the disease affects every generation, it is a dominant trait. An autosomal dominant trait 
                              will affect about 50% of both males and females from an affected parent who is heterozygous. Recessive traits tend to 
                              skip generations and can often skip several generations as many parents get the trait, but not the full 
                              disease. The pedigree is a great tool for genetics to track a trait across generations to get valuable 
                              insight into how its passed from one generation to the next.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="meiosis">Meiosis</h2>
                         <p>
                              Meiosis is a 2 stage process for the formation of gametes which are used to pass on the genetic information 
                              for reproduction. The first cell cycle is called Meiosis I and it is the duplication of the chromosomes 
                              into homologous chromatids. During Meiosis I the process of all 46 chromosomes getting copied by DNA synthesis 
                              is the same as in mitosis. You end up with 46 homologous chromatids. What happens when the cells actually 
                              split, is very different. The first major difference between mitosis and meiosis is how the chromosomes line up. 
                              In mitosis they all line up in a row with the tubulin binding to each and every copy. In meiosis the chromosomes 
                              pair up. The mom and dads chromosome 1 will pair together and synapse. This allows for the process of 
                              crossing over. This is where parts of the homologous chromosomes will swap some of their DNA segments.
                              This means parts of the chromatids from moms' #1 chromosome and parts of the chromatids of dad's #1 chromosome 
                              will swap parts of their DNA. This is called crossing over or recombination. The term recombination is used 
                              whenever DNA recombines in new ways. After the crossing over in Meiosis I, the tubulin will reach out and bind one 
                              of the chromosomes in each pair. That means one new cell will get mom's #1 homologous chromatids and the other 
                              cell will get dad's #1 homologous chromatids.  This is often called the reduction phase as the new cells go from 
                              Diploid with 2 copies of each chromosome to Haploid which is just 1 copy of each chromosome. You can get a 
                              new cell with mom's #1, #2 and #5 chromosomes and dad's #3, #4 and #6 chromosomes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              After the cell splits into 2 new cells, each new cell will have a full set of chromatids for each chromosome. 
                              Some of the chromosomes will be from mom and some of them from dad. Then the process of Meiosis II will 
                              begin to break up the chromatids. The DNA does not get copied again in meiosis II. It only goes through the process 
                              of splitting the DNA and creating 2 new cells. This will go like Mitosis where the tubulin will bind to 
                              each side of the sister chromatids for each chromosome. Then the separase enzyme will cut apart the sister chromatids, 
                              and then a copy of each chromosome will move to each new cell. This process starts out by duplicating the 
                              chromosomes into chromatids, then it sorts them into new cells, and finally it splits the chromatids.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This process starts out by duplicating the 
                              chromosomes into chromatids, then it sorts them into new cells, and finally it splits the chromatids.
                              This leaves each of the final gametes with exactly half the genetic information in the form of just 1 copy 
                              of each chromosome. Some of them will be from mom and some of them will be from dad. This random shuffling 
                              of the genetic information gives variation to the species.
