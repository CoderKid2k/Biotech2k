                    <h2 class="science-headers" id="structure">DNA Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                         Both DNA and RNA are made up of the basic components called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is made up of 
                         3 smaller parts. There is the nucleic acid often called the base, the ribose sugar and then the 
                         phosphate group. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The first part is the base which is made up of the 5 basic nucleic acids with Adenine, 
                         Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine and Uracil. There are a few attributes of nucleic acids for us to cover. The 
                         first thing about the 5 nucleic acids is they are made of Nitrogenous bases. All other structures we see 
                         in biology are made from carbon structures. The nucleic acids are made up of nitrogen. That makes them 
                         unique from other chemical structures. The next thing you will notice is some of these has 2 rings and
                         the others have a single ring structure. The Adenine and Guanine have 2 rings and we call these the 
                         Purines. The Cytosine, Thymine and Uracil all have a single ring. We call them the Pyrimidines.  There are
                         a total of 5 nucleic acids but only 4 get used in DNA and 4 get used in RNA. The Adenine, Guanine and 
                         Cytosine are used in both DNA and RNA. The major difference is that Thymine is used and DNA and Uracil 
                         replaces it in the RNA. If you look at the Thymine vs Uracil, they are actually very similar structures. 
                         The Thymine has an extra Methane group. This is the main difference between Thymine in DNA and Uracil in 
                         RNA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         One major difference I want to point out will be important later when we talk about base editing. 
                         Base Editing uses and enzyme called a Deaminase. This enzyme plucks off the Amino group of a nucleic 
                         acid. And amino group is an NH grouping. The Adenine only differs from Guanine by a lone NH2 group 
                         (amino group) at the top. If you pluck that off with a deaminase, you can facilitate the transition 
                         to a Guanine. The same applies to the Cytosine amino group that can be removed to transition to a Thymine. 
                         This is a concept I wanted to touch on in the structure section as we cover Base Editing later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The next part of the Nucleotide will be the Ribose sugar. The ribose sugar comes with 5 carbons in its 
                         structure. The carbon actually look like a Big Dipper formation. Its held into a pentagon shape my a 
                         lone oxygen at the top center. When dealing with a carbon structure like ribose, we number the carbons 
                         using the Prime designation which is represented with an '. So the 1 prime carbon (1') is the first 
                         carbon on the far right that the nucleic acid binds to. The 2' carbon is where we determine Ribose from 
                         Deoxyribose. The ribose has the hydroxyl (OH) group which makes it ribose. When the OH group is replaced
                         with just a hydrogen, that is the Deoxyribose. The Deoxyribose is used in DNA as that OH group would interfere 
                         with the bonding of the base pairs in DNA. The last part of the Nucleotide is the Phosphate group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The phosphate group is actually a charged molecule that wants to bind to  another molecule 
                         because it carries a negative charge. The phosphate group binds to the 5' carbon. This leaves 
                         only the 3' and 2' carbons not used. Then it bonds again to the 3' carbon of the pervious nucleotide. 
                         This creates a linker of phophates from the 5' of one base to the 3' of the next base.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         This basic formation is the basic repetitive group of DNA or RNA. The phosphate group binds to the 5' 
                         carbon of the ribose sugar then it will bind again to the 3' carbon of the previous nucleotide in the 
                         DNA structure. This binding of the phosphate group from the 5' carbon of one nucleotide to the 3' carbon 
                         of the previous nucleotide strings the nucleotide together into a long strand of DNA. This is how we number
                         the DNA as it is read from 5' to 3' along that strand of DNA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         We know that DNA is made up of 2 strands. The first strand will run 5' to 3' while the other 
                         strand will run from 3' to 5' creating an exact opposite copy of the first strand. We call this 
                         antiparallel. This brings us to the concept of base paring of the nucleic acids in the double stranded 
                         DNA structure. This is called the Chargaff's rule. He measured the amounts of each nucleic acid used in 
                         the DNA and found that the amount of Adenine was always equal to the Thymine. While the amount of Guanine
                         was always equal to the amount of Thymine. This led to the conclusion that Adenine based paired with 
                         Thymine and Guanine base paired with Cytosine. One purine with one pyrimidine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The Adenine base pairs with Thymine using 2 hydrogen bonds while the Guanine base pairs with the Thymine 
                         using 3 hydrogen bonds. This hydrogen bonding establishes a weak bond that can be opened when enzymes want 
                         to copy or replicate the DNA. The base pairing of the DNA with one strand running in one direction and the 
                         other strand running in the opposite direction gives us the double helix structure of the DNA. This is the 
                         double stranded DNA structure we associate with Human DNA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The nucleic acids face the inside of the structure as they are electrostatically 
                         charged and bind to each other. The phosphates are on the outside and make up the 
                         phosphate backbone of the DNA double helix. This is because the phosphate will protect the DNA from the 
                         watery environment around it. When it comes to RNA, its structure is single stranded so it tends to fold 
                         up and base pair with matching nucleic acids forming Stem and Loop formations.
