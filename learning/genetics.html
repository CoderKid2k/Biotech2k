                    <section>
                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="structure">DNA Structure</h2>
                         <p>
                              Both DNA and RNA are made up of the basic components called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is made up of 
                              3 smaller parts. There is the nucleic acid often called the base, the ribose sugar and then the 
                              phosphate group. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first part is the base which is made up of the 5 basic nucleic acids with Adenine, 
                              Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine and Uracil. There are a few attributes of nucleic acids for us to cover. The 
                              first thing about the 5 nucleic acids is they are made of Nitrogenous bases. All other structures we see 
                              in biology are made from carbon structures. The nucleic acids are made up of nitrogen. That makes them 
                              unique from other chemical structures. The next thing you will notice is some of these has 2 rings and
                              the others have a single ring structure. The Adenine and Guanine have 2 rings and we call these the 
                              Purines. The Cytosine, Thymine and Uracil all have a single ring. We call them the Pyrimidines.  There are
                              a total of 5 nucleic acids but only 4 get used in DNA and 4 get used in RNA. The Adenine, Guanine and 
                              Cytosine are used in both DNA and RNA. The major difference is that Thymine is used and DNA and Uracil 
                              replaces it in the RNA. If you look at the Thymine vs Uracil, they are actually very similar structures. 
                              The Thymine has an extra Methane group. This is the main difference between Thymine in DNA and Uracil in 
                              RNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              One major difference I want to point out will be important later when we talk about base editing. 
                              Base Editing uses and enzyme called a Deaminase. This enzyme plucks off the Amino group of a nucleic 
                              acid. And amino group is an NH grouping. The Adenine only differs from Guanine by a lone NH2 group 
                              (amino group) at the top. If you pluck that off with a deaminase, you can facilitate the transition 
                              to a Guanine. The same applies to the Cytosine amino group that can be removed to transition to a Thymine. 
                              This is a concept I wanted to touch on in the structure section as we cover Base Editing later.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next part of the Nucleotide will be the Ribose sugar. The ribose sugar comes with 5 carbons in its 
                              structure. The carbon actually look like a Big Dipper formation. Its held into a pentagon shape my a 
                              lone oxygen at the top center. When dealing with a carbon structure like ribose, we number the carbons 
                              using the Prime designation which is represented with an '. So the 1 prime carbon (1') is the first 
                              carbon on the far right that the nucleic acid binds to. The 2' carbon is where we determine Ribose from 
                              Deoxyribose. The ribose has the hydroxyl (OH) group which makes it ribose. When the OH group is replaced
                              with just a hydrogen, that is the Deoxyribose. The Deoxyribose is used in DNA as that OH group would interfere 
                              with the bonding of the base pairs in DNA. The last part of the Nucleotide is the Phosphate group.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The phosphate group is actually a charged molecule that wants to bind to  another molecule 
                              because it carries a negative charge. The phosphate group binds to the 5' carbon. This leaves 
                              only the 3' and 2' carbons not used. Then it bonds again to the 3' carbon of the pervious nucleotide. 
                              This creates a linker of phophates from the 5' of one base to the 3' of the next base.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This basic formation is the basic repetitive group of DNA or RNA. The phosphate group binds to the 5' 
                              carbon of the ribose sugar then it will bind again to the 3' carbon of the previous nucleotide in the 
                              DNA structure. This binding of the phosphate group from the 5' carbon of one nucleotide to the 3' carbon 
                              of the previous nucleotide strings the nucleotide together into a long strand of DNA. This is how we number
                              the DNA as it is read from 5' to 3' along that strand of DNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              We know that DNA is made up of 2 strands. The first strand will run 5' to 3' while the other 
                              strand will run from 3' to 5' creating an exact opposite copy of the first strand. We call this 
                              antiparallel. This brings us to the concept of base paring of the nucleic acids in the double stranded 
                              DNA structure. This is called the Chargaff's rule. He measured the amounts of each nucleic acid used in 
                              the DNA and found that the amount of Adenine was always equal to the Thymine. While the amount of Guanine
                              was always equal to the amount of Thymine. This led to the conclusion that Adenine based paired with 
                              Thymine and Guanine base paired with Cytosine. One purine with one pyrimidine.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Adenine base pairs with Thymine using 2 hydrogen bonds while the Guanine base pairs with the Thymine 
                              using 3 hydrogen bonds. This hydrogen bonding establishes a weak bond that can be opened when enzymes want 
                              to copy or replicate the DNA. The base pairing of the DNA with one strand running in one direction and the 
                              other strand running in the opposite direction gives us the double helix structure of the DNA. This is the 
                              double stranded DNA structure we associate with Human DNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The nucleic acids face the inside of the structure as they are electrostatically 
                              charged and bind to each other. The phosphates are on the outside and make up the 
                              phosphate backbone of the DNA double helix. This is because the phosphate will protect the DNA from the 
                              watery environment around it. When it comes to RNA, its structure is single stranded so it tends to fold 
                              up and base pair with matching nucleic acids forming Stem and Loop formations.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="package">DNA Packaging</h2>
                         <p>
                              Now that we covered the basic structure of the DNA with nucleotides, base pairing, anti 
                              parallel and double stranding of the DNA. Next we want to look at the double Helix of the 
                              DNA and how DNA is packaged.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              As the DNA is strung together into its base paired double stranded structure it begins to coil around. 
                              Each one of these twists in the DNA is about 10 nucleotides long. This twisting formation of the double stranded 
                              DNA structure creates 2 groves in the structure called the Minor Groove and the Major Groove. This can be 
                              important in some DNA concepts so understand the 2 different grooves.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The overall DNA strand will have a slight negative charge. We will begin to look at the basic component 
                              of DNA packaging called the Nucleosome. This is made up of a Histone protein and the DNA that gets 
                              wrapped around it. The full nucleosome includes the Histone and all the DNA wrapped around it including 
                              the DNA that links to the next nucleosome in the sequence.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The histone itself is made up of 4 basic proteins called H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. The Histone brings 
                              together each of these 4 proteins to make a circular structure that the DNA can wrap around. A complete histone 
                              is 2 of these wheel like structures called an octamer. That allows the DNA to wrap twice around each histone octamer
                              with it wrapping once around each set of histone proteins once. The histone octamer has a slight positive charge 
                              that allows it to bind to the slightly negatively charged DNA and create stable binding. The histone is a 
                              very important part of DNA packaging and Epigenetic regulation of genes. When the DNA is packaged on the histone, it is 
                              inactive as no enzymes that interact with the DNA can gain access to the DNA while its packaged. The 
                              Histones block the binding of these enzymes. This is how cells can regulate which genes are active 
                              (unpackaged) and which ones are inactive (packaged). Only when DNA is unpackaged can it be accessed for 
                              transcription.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The vast majority of DNA in a cell will be packaged on the histones as it won't be necessary for that 
                              specific cell. On the histone proteins, there will be small protein tails. These tails are extremely 
                              important in gene regulation and expression. The histone tails control which genes get unpackaged from the histone 
                              and which do not. This is done by adding or removing Acetyl groups to the histone tails. When acetyl groups 
                              are added, the DNA will bind to the histone preventing gene activation. When the acetyl groups are removed, the histones 
                              will come off the DNA exposing it for transcription. There is a set of enzymes responsible for adding and 
                              removing the acetyl groups on the histone tails to regulate the packaging and unpackaging of the DNA for 
                              transcription. These enzymes are called Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes that add the acetyl 
                              groups and Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes that remove the acetyl groups.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The nucleosome is made when the DNA is wrapped twice around the 2 sets of histone proteins that make up 
                              the overall histone protein octamer. The nucleosome also includes the strand of linker DNA that spans to 
                              the next nucleosome in the sequence. This creates a string of beads like structure from the double stranded
                              DNA. This is the first level of packaging called the 11 nanometer (nm). The next level of packaging is 
                              called the 30 nm level. The 30 nm level of packaging requires the H1 histone protein which acts like a spacer 
                              to bring the histones together into a tight formation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next level of DNA packaging is the 300 nm level of packaging. This uses a DNA structural protein and 
                              folds the DNA into loops down the side of the protein. The next level of DNA packaging is the 700 nm level of 
                              packaging. This takes the 300 nm that is looped down the side of the structural protein. It then 
                              wraps that structural protein into another coil further compressing it. The final stage of packaging is that of 
                              the 1400 nm. This is the fully compressed DNA into the common chromosome structure we often associate with 
                              DNA. This level of packaging is only done when the DNA condenses during the cell cycle when it compresses 
                              to undergo mitosis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When DNA is densly packaged it is called heterochromatin. When its loosely packaged, its called 
                              euchromatin. Euchromatin is transcriptionally active. Most of the time, the DNA is in the euchromatin state 
                              because it is actively being used. The heterochramtin is more densly packed and not transcriptionally active.
                              Some parts of the chromosome are always densly packed like around the centromere and the telomeres. These spaces 
                              contain no active genes as they are never active.

                         <p>
                              The human genome is over 3 billion bases long in the DNA. This would be an unbelievably long strand of 
                              DNA. The human genome makes it more manageable by braking it up into 23 chromosomes. Each chromosome 
                              contains specific parts of the overall genetic information. The first chromosomes are the largest and 
                              contain the most genes. As we go through the chromosomes, they get smaller and smaller except the last 
                              one. The first 22 are called the autosomes. They contain the exact same genes on each of these chromosomes.
                              The last set of chromosomes are called the sex chromosomes and it determines the sex of the child. Each 
                              person gets 23 chromosomes from their mom and another 23 chromosomes from their dad for a set of 23 with 
                              46 chomosomes in total. If the 23rd chromosomes are both an X chromosome, the child is female. If there is an X and a Y 
                              chromosome for this set, the child will be male. The very last set of chromosomes actually determines 
                              sex in human genetics. This is because the Y chromosome carries the genes that determine male characteristics.

                              The term ploidy is used in genetics to represent how many copies of each chromosome each species has. If a 
                              cell has only 1 copy of each chromosome, like our germline cells, that is haploid. Often shown as (N). If a cell has 2 
                              copies of each chromosome, like our somatic cells, its called diploid (2N). Some species have more chromosomes.
                              The strawberry is octoploid with 8 copies of each chromosome. The understanding of the chromosomes, their 
                              structure and copy number is important in human disease. There can be chromosomal defects that can occur in 
                              the shape or even number of chromosomes. When cells end up with a wrong number in a specific chromosome, 
                              we call that aneuploidy. The typical cell gets 2 copies of each chromosome in humans. The term Monosomy 
                              means each cell only gets a single copy of a specific chromosome. Tuner Syndrome is an example of a monosomy 
                              disorder where the person gets only 1 copy of the X chromosome. Trisomy occurs when a person gets 3 copies 
                              of a specific chromosome. There are a few disorders that stem from a trisomy of a specific chromosome. The most 
                              commonly known is Trisomy 21 which leads to Down Syndrome. The number of chromosomes can change in specific 
                              cells during cancer genomic instability.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Cancer can also lead to rearrangements of the chromosomes. These are called translocations. It occurs 
                              when a part of 1 or more chromosomes is cut off an placed on another chromosome. These can be reciprocal 
                              or nonreciprocal translocations. One of the most famous translocations in cancer is called the Philadelphia 
                              Chromosome. Its a reciprocal translocation where part of the 9 and 22 chromosome swap a section of their 
                              DNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next concept for chromosomes is the location of their Centromere. The centromere is a key part of 
                              the chromosome that plays a role in binding proteins to segregate the chromosomes during cell 
                              replication. There are 4 types of centromeres and they are named by their location in the chromosome. 
                              If the centromere is right in the center, its called metacentric. If its slightly off center, it is called 
                              sub metacentric. If the centromere is closer to the end of the chromosome, then its acrocentric. If its at 
                              the very end of the centromere, then its telocentric. There are no natural telocentric human chromosomes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              You sometimes hear the term that a gene is located on the short or long arm of the chromosome. this refers 
                              to the smaller part of an acrocentric chromosome. The long arm would be the longer part of the acrocentric 
                              chromosome.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last part of the chromosome is the Telomere. This is the cap on the ends of each chromosome. It 
                              plays a key role in cell division. The telomere is there to protect the ends of the DNA strands.  Each time 
                              a cell copies its DNA for mitosis, the telomere gets a little shorter. This is called the Hayflick  limit 
                              and averages 40 to 60 times a cell can go through mitosis before it hits this limit. Once any cell hits this 
                              limit it goes into senescence which it will no longer divide. This plays a role in many age related 
                              disorders. Stem cells express the gene for an enzyme that is called telomerase. The telomerase enzyme extends 
                              the telomere each time the cell divides making stem cells immortal. This leads to one of the hallmarks of 
                              cancer. Cancer cells turn on the gene for telomerase enzyme allowing them to become immortal.

                         <p>
                              There are about 3 billion nucleotides in the human genome across 23 pairs of Chromosomes. It would take a very 
                              long time to copy all of the DNA with just one set of replication enzymes. This means the DNA will 
                              synthesize using many points of replication. The site where the replication starts is called the origin of replication. 
                              There is one of these replication start points every several thousand nucleotides in the human genome. 
                              These are at sites rich with A and T pairs as they have less bonds which makes it easier for the replication
                              enzymes to open up the DNA and get started.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The first enzyme will be Helicase which opens the DNA at the origin of replication. It unzips the DNA along the 
                              hydrogen bonds that hold the DNA together. The spot at which the Helicase unzips the DNA is called the 
                              replication fork. Since the DNA has an electrostatic charge, it will want to snap back closed. There is a set 
                              of proteins called Single Strand Binding (SSB) proteins that bind to each strand of the DNA and stabilizes 
                              the charges. The DNA polymerase that is responsible for copying the DNA can only bind to double stranded DNA, 
                              but in this case the DNA is separated and each stand is alone. There is a RNA primase that comes in and 
                              lays in a few RNA primers into the starting spot so the DNA polymerase can attach. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Both strands are copied at the same time. Each original strand acts as a template while a new strand is 
                              synthesized from each of the original strands. This process leaves each new DNA with 1 original strand 
                              bound to 1 new strand. This process of taking one original strand and using it as a template to make a new 
                              strand leaves each new copy of the DNA with one original paired with one new strand. This is called the 
                              Semiconservative model of DNA replication.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The DNA polymerase has to read the DNA going from the 3' to the 5' direction because it creates DNA from 
                              5' to 3' direction. This makes one strand of the DNA easy to copy. The polymerase just binds to the 3' end 
                              and goes copying the DNA along the way as it is always moving forward. The stand that starts at the 3' 
                              end and continues with the flow of the replication fork is called the Leading Strand. The DNA polymerase 
                              just moves along this strand copying the template strand into a new strand as it goes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The other strand runs in the opposite direction of this leading strand. That mean the DNA polymerase has to
                              work backward as that strand is going in the 5' to 3' direction. It does this by jumping several thousand 
                              nucleotides ahead and working backwards. These sections of DNA, it copies by jumping ahead and working backwards, are 
                              called Okazaki fragments. Initially, they are not connected together. There is another enzyme that comes 
                              along and connects these Okazaki fragment together. This enzyme is called DNA ligase.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Because the DNA is wound together into a double helix, the unwinding of the DNA causes tension on the DNA.
                              If that tension isn't released, it will build until it stops the helicase. There is another enzyme that binds to 
                              the double strands of DNA ahead of the helicase enzyme. As the tension on the DNA gets too high, the 
                              topoisomerase enzyme will break the bonds of the DNA and allow it to unwind the tension before binding it 
                              back together. The topoisomerase is a critical enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis to release the 
                              tension. There are cancer drugs that target this topoisomerase enzyme to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly 
                              replicating cells. This causes the DNA to break from the tension and the cells undergo cell death.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The process of DNA synthesis occurs during the cell cycle in the S phase of the cycle. This
                              is the only time the DNA gets copied before the cell undergoes mitosis or mieosis.

                              The DNA of the cell serves as a master blue print. Every cell of our body has a complete copy of this DNA 
                              blueprint. Depending on the cell and its functions, it will use specific parts of the blueprint found in 
                              the DNA to produce the proteins and enzymes needed by that cell. The rule is that each gene contains all the 
                              DNA to create one fully functional protein or enzyme. The Central Dogma of Biology states that DNA creates 
                              RNA which creates proteins.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The gene itself has a few key regions that are important to be familiar with. The very first nucleotide to be 
                              copied is the start of the actual gene. The part that of the DNA that gets copied is called the Open Reading 
                              Frame (ORF). The gene includes all the nucleotides that make up the actual messenger RNA. The next important 
                              part about the DNA is the promoter. The promoter starts about 50 to 100 nucleotides before the gene starting
                              nucleotide. The most basic part of the promoter is called the TATA box. Its a sequence of Thymine and Adenine 
                              nucleotides. The transcription factors will bind to the promoter region and build the initiation complex 
                              for gene transcription on the TATA box. There is actually a big complex of proteins that must bind to the promoter 
                              region before the RNA polymerase. This is called the initiation complex. It starts with the TATA binding 
                              protein (TBP) and builds this complex that recruits RNA polymerase.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The RNA Polymerase II enzyme will bind to the Initiation Complex and begin copying the gene starting 
                              with the first start nucleotide and proceeds till it reaches the termination point. Then the RNA 
                              Pol II will fall off and the primary transcript will be finished. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The next important part of a gene is the regulatory regions. These are located located thousands of bases 
                              before the promoter region. This is because the DNA will flip over and the regulatory region will make 
                              contact with the promoter. The regulatory region can bind transcription factors called Repressors or Enhancers. 
                              The DNA will fold in a loop which allows these Repressors or Enhancers to come in contact with the promoter.
                              This will allow the Repressor to block binding of the RNA polymerase. An Enhancer can bind to the regulatory
                              region too. It will make contact 
                              with the RNA polymerase, but it will increase the activity of the RNA polymerase leading to increased gene 
                              expression. Once the transcription factors have bound to the promoter region, the RNA polymerase can bind to the
                              transcription factors and begin copying the gene if there is no repressor on the regulatory element. 
                              It can also be increased by an enhancer.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The RNA polymerase opens up the DNA itself as it binds to the initiation complex. It doesn't need any 
                              assistance like the DNA polymerase did. It will begin copying the DNA using one strand of DNA as a 
                              template and create a RNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction. The RNA polymerase must use the same rules 
                              as the DNA polymerase. It reads the DNA from 3' to the 5' direction so it can create the RNA in the 
                              5' to 3' direction.

                              The initial strand of the RNA is called the primary transcript. It will undergo three modifications before
                              it can leave the nucleus of the cell. The first is it will undergo splicing by the spliceosome complex. The 
                              vast majority of the gene is made up of non coding information called introns. The actual coding part of 
                              the gene is called the exons. The spliceosome will follow splicing marks on the primary RNA and 
                              remove all the introns and paste the exons back together. This also leads to the ability of alternative
                              splicing by cells to use a gene differently. One cell might use Exons 1, 2, 4, and 5 while another might
                              use Exons 1, 3, 4 and 5. That is the concept of alternative splicing.
                              There are about 22,000 genes, but we know there are over 100,000 proteins in the human body. Most of this 
                              variation is done by alternative splicing. Different cells will use different splicing to create different 
                              variants of a protein.

                              After the splicing of the RNA is complete, there are enzymes that will add a Guanine cap to the 5' end
                              of the RNA. This serves to allow the RNA to exit the nucleus and assists in loading the RNA into the
                              Ribosome. The last process is the addition of the poly A tail. This just adds about 250 or more Adenine
                              nucleotides to the end of the RNA. This signifies the end of the RNA when its read by the Ribosome.

                              The final RNA product is now called a messenger RNA (mRNA). Its built to take the DNA information
                              and deliver it to the Ribosome for production of a protein. The concept of a fully processed mRNA is 
                              important.  In Virology, you will see many RNA based viruses. You might think, since it is RNA, it can 
                              go right into the cell and start making proteins. That isn't always true. Many of them are not properly 
                              formatted into the mRNA format necessary to load into the Ribosome.

                              When a strand of DNA or RNA runs in the 5' to 3' direction, we call that the positive or sense strand.
                              When it rund is the opposite direction from 3' to 5' direction, we call that a negative or Antisense
                              strand. The messenger RNA that is created by transcription is positive or sense strand. Many virues are
                              negative strand or antisense. They have to be translated into the opposite form before they can be used 
                              by the Ribosomes.
