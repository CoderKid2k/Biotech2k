                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="anemia">Anemia</h2>
                         <p> 
                              For Anemia, the blood test will reveal low Hematocrit, low Hemoglobin and most likely low Red Blood cell 
                              counts. There is one anemia in Beta Thalassemia where you can have higher levels of RBCs in the 
                              6 million range, but all others will show low levels of RBCs. The types of anemia are broken 
                              down into 3 categories with microcytic, normocytic and macrocytic based on the MCV levels.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Microcytic anemias consist of the type of anemia where the red blood cells can't form enough healthy 
                              cells. We know as the Red Blood Cell matures, it gets smaller and smaller. The microcytic anemias have 
                              small red cells with a MCV below 80 fl. This is because they wait and wait for all the proper materials 
                              like Iron, protoporphyrin or globin proteins. When they can't get enough, they end up just making smaller 
                              Red Blood Cells. This includes Iron Deficiency Anemia, Thalassemia and Sideroblastic Anemia. I have talked 
                              about Iron deficiency and Thalassemia before as they are key microcytic anemias. Sideroblastic anemia has 
                              a genetic form, but most of the acquired sideroblastic anemia comes from toxins like Lead poisoning.  In 
                              Sideroblastic anemia, the iron clumps up to make small visible clumps which makes them look like basophils. 
                              These can often be seen in the bone marrow or a blood smear. We call this Basophilic Stippling.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Thalassemia comes in 2 forms with Alpha and Beta Thalassemia. This is a genetic disease where there is a 
                              loss of one or more of the genes that makes the globin proteins for the hemoglobin. In Alpha Thalassemia, 
                              the red blood cells make little or no Alpha globin proteins. In Beta Thalassemia, the red blood cells will 
                              make little to no beta globin proteins. Depending on how severe these Thalassemia is, they will make very 
                              little to no globins which are necessary to for the 2 alpha globin and 2 beta globin structure of the 
                              Hemoglobin. What ends up happening is you get hemoglobin made with 4 alpha proteins or 4 beta proteins. 
                              They work, but those RBCs tend to die very quickly when they reach circulation. Then you have hemolysis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last microcytic anemia is Iron Deficiency. This is the most common form of anemia world wide due to 
                              malnutrition. In the develop world, there are genetic disorders that can lead to iron deficiency. The most 
                              common are related to high cell growth like child development or pregnancy. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Next up is the Macrocytic anemias. These have very large cells as they tend to release very large and 
                              immature Red Blood cells. They tend to have a MCV over 100 fl. The Macrocytic anemias get dividend into 
                              Megaloblastic and Non megaloblastic. The Megaloblastic will be accompanied with hypersegmented neutrophils. 
                              The typical neutrophil will have 3 to 5 lobes in its nucleus. These hypersegmented neutrophils will 7 or
                              more lobes. The 2 major Megaloblastic Anemias are B12 deficiency and Folate deficiency. These are nutritional 
                              anemias. These are easily corrected with a high dose of intermuscular B12 or Folate. They are often 
                              nutritional and can be related to GI diseases. The one thing that stands out about B12 deficiency is it can 
                              come with some neurocognitive symptoms. These can be in the from of mood changes to memory loss. This is 
                              the one key factor that separates B12 from Folate deficiency.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The top 3 causes of Non Megaloblastic anemia is Liver Disease. Alcoholism and Medications. All of these we 
                              will not dive into. This brings us back to the normocytic anemias. These get subdivided into the intrinsic 
                              defects and extrinsic defects of the RBC. Intrinsic are those anemias that stem from a genetic defect of 
                              the RBC like the spherocytosis and eliptocytosis from the structure protein defects. Then their is Sickle 
                              Cell anemia which comes from a mutation in the Beta Globin. Sickle Cell anemia will cause the hemoglobin to 
                              polymerize when in low O2 leading to the sickling of the RBC. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Next would be a G6PD which comes from a missing enzyme which helps covert Oxygen radicals back into water to 
                              clear them. This leads to the build up of O2 radicals. This is important with beans like Fava Beans. They 
                              can lead to G6PD attacks. The next will be Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). This is a 
                              defect in the proteins that get made on the cell surface to defend cells from being attack my the 
                              complement system. Most of these normalcytic anemias are the destruction anemias where the Red Blood 
                              Cells get destroyed.
