                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="anemia">Anemia</h2>
                         <p> 
                              For Anemia, the blood test will reveal low Hematocrit, low Hemoglobin and most likely low Red Blood cell 
                              counts. There is one anemia in Beta Thalassemia where you can have higher levels of RBCs in the 
                              6 million range, but all others will show low levels of RBCs. The types of anemia are broken 
                              down into 3 categories with microcytic, normocytic and macrocytic based on the MCV levels.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Microcytic anemias consist of the type of anemia where the red blood cells can't form enough healthy 
                              cells. We know as the Red Blood Cell matures, it gets smaller and smaller. The microcytic anemias have 
                              small red cells with a MCV below 80 fl. This is because they wait and wait for all the proper materials 
                              like Iron, protoporphyrin or globin proteins. When they can't get enough, they end up just making smaller 
                              Red Blood Cells. This includes Iron Deficiency Anemia, Thalassemia and Sideroblastic Anemia. I have talked 
                              about Iron deficiency and Thalassemia before as they are key microcytic anemias. Sideroblastic anemia has 
                              a genetic form, but most of the acquired sideroblastic anemia comes from toxins like Lead poisoning.  In 
                              Sideroblastic anemia, the iron clumps up to make small visible clumps which makes them look like basophils. 
                              These can often be seen in the bone marrow or a blood smear. We call this Basophilic Stippling.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Thalassemia comes in 2 forms with Alpha and Beta Thalassemia. This is a genetic disease where there is a 
                              loss of one or more of the genes that makes the globin proteins for the hemoglobin. In Alpha Thalassemia, 
                              the red blood cells make little or no Alpha globin proteins. In Beta Thalassemia, the red blood cells will 
                              make little to no beta globin proteins. Depending on how severe these Thalassemia is, they will make very 
                              little to no globins which are necessary to for the 2 alpha globin and 2 beta globin structure of the 
                              Hemoglobin. What ends up happening is you get hemoglobin made with 4 alpha proteins or 4 beta proteins. 
                              They work, but those RBCs tend to die very quickly when they reach circulation. Then you have hemolysis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last microcytic anemia is Iron Deficiency. This is the most common form of anemia world wide due to 
                              malnutrition. In the develop world, there are genetic disorders that can lead to iron deficiency. The most 
                              common are related to high cell growth like child development or pregnancy. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Next up is the Macrocytic anemias. These have very large cells as they tend to release very large and 
                              immature Red Blood cells. They tend to have a MCV over 100 fl. The Macrocytic anemias get dividend into 
                              Megaloblastic and Non megaloblastic. The Megaloblastic will be accompanied with hypersegmented neutrophils. 
                              The typical neutrophil will have 3 to 5 lobes in its nucleus. These hypersegmented neutrophils will 7 or
                              more lobes. The 2 major Megaloblastic Anemias are B12 deficiency and Folate deficiency. These are nutritional 
                              anemias. These are easily corrected with a high dose of intermuscular B12 or Folate. They are often 
                              nutritional and can be related to GI diseases. The one thing that stands out about B12 deficiency is it can 
                              come with some neurocognitive symptoms. These can be in the from of mood changes to memory loss. This is 
                              the one key factor that separates B12 from Folate deficiency.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The top 3 causes of Non Megaloblastic anemia is Liver Disease. Alcoholism and Medications. All of these we 
                              will not dive into. This brings us back to the normocytic anemias. These get subdivided into the intrinsic 
                              defects and extrinsic defects of the RBC. Intrinsic are those anemias that stem from a genetic defect of 
                              the RBC like the spherocytosis and eliptocytosis from the structure protein defects. Then their is Sickle 
                              Cell anemia which comes from a mutation in the Beta Globin. Sickle Cell anemia will cause the hemoglobin to 
                              polymerize when in low O2 leading to the sickling of the RBC. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Next would be a G6PD which comes from a missing enzyme which helps covert Oxygen radicals back into water to 
                              clear them. This leads to the build up of O2 radicals. This is important with beans like Fava Beans. They 
                              can lead to G6PD attacks. The next will be Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). This is a 
                              defect in the proteins that get made on the cell surface to defend cells from being attack my the 
                              complement system. Most of these normalcytic anemias are the destruction anemias where the Red Blood 
                              Cells get destroyed.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="scd">Sickle Cell Disease</h2>
                         <p> 
                              The actual disease of SCD is caused by a single base mutation in the Hemoglobin Beta (HbB) gene that 
                              makes the HbB protein as part of the Hemoglobin. This single change encodes a different amino acid.
                              The properties of this different amino acid causes the HbB to bind together into long strands under 
                              low oxygen conditions. This in turn causes the Red Blood cell to take on a Sickle like shape. We call 
                              this form of Hemoglobin Beta HbS for Sickling. 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              The HbS gene is prominent in Africa with 1 in 365 
                              Africans having the HbS gene. It has a lower occurrence in Asians and some South Americans. This gene 
                              is very prominent in areas of the world where Malaria is endemic.  Malaria is an infectious disease 
                              carried by mosquitoes. This disease infects red blood cells. The HbS makes these cells resistant to 
                              infection by Malaria. This is why this allele of the HbB gene has evolved.  A single copy of the gene 
                              will offer protection from a horrible infectious disease. Getting 2 copies of this gene leads to Sickle 
                              Cell Disease. This disease works in an Autosomal Recessive capacity. That means each person gets 2 copies 
                              of the HbB gene (1 from mom and 1 from dad). To get SCD, the patient has to inherit one copy of the HbS 
                              gene from both mom and dad. That means mom and dad both must be at least carriers of that trait. The world
                              has about 300,000 cases of SCD each year with the vast majority coming from Africa. Many of these cases 
                              are in countries where healthcare is not available. The US cases of SCD is 90,000 with about 2,000 births 
                              per year. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When a baby is first born, they will still be producing Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF). This is made up 
                              of alpha and gamma protein. By 6 months of age, they will be developing Red Blood cells with Adult 
                              Hemoglobin. This Adult Hemoglobin (HbA) will be made up of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains. This is when the HbS 
                              will show up as the infant begins to make HbA with the mutated HbS gene. The symptoms of SCD are Anemia.
                              The blood counts will show anemia with Low Hematocrit and Low Hemoglobin levels. You would see Hematocrit 
                              around 25% and Hb around 9 or less. This is the first sign of Sickle Cell. The iron studies will typically 
                              be normal which rules out iron deficiency. You will have signs of Hemolysis with elevated LDH, Unconjugated 
                              Bilirubin, and low Haptoglobin. This is because these Red Blood cells with the HbS will not live as long 
                              as unhealthy RBCs. The typical RBC lives about 120 days. The SCD red blood cell will live about 20 days.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This means a lot of cells are being destroyed in the vessels (intravascular) and the spleen (extravascular). 
                              Due to the Sickling shape of these Red blood cells, you can get what are called Sickle cell crisis and Vaso 
                              Occlusive Crisis. This comes from the sickled cells blocking veins. When they block up the smaller veins in 
                              the tissue or bone marrow, it can cause very painful crisis. Many of these patients end up hospitalized 
                              with opioid use. These sickled cells can also restrict blood flow causing potentially life threatening Vaso 
                              Occlusive Crisis. This can lead to stroke or heart attacks. The last major symptom is Splenomegaly. This is 
                              an enlargement of the spleen. This is also caused by the trapping of sickle cells in the spleen. Most SCD 
                              patients will end up with getting their spleen removed. The treatment for SCD is Hydroxyurea which helps 
                              boost the production of Fetal hemoglobin. It offers modest benefit to boost Hematocrit and Hb.

                         <p>
                              There are gene editing programs in development that extract the stem cells from the bone marrow of the 
                              patients. They edit these cells to correct the mutated HbS alleles. They will deplete the remaining stem 
                              cells from the bone marrow and replace them. They put the corrected stem cells back into the patient. This 
                              is a long and complex process of extraction of stem cells, manufacturing and administration of the new 
                              cells after a very toxic Busulfan Myleoablation. This does offer possible functional cures to patients based 
                              on the data.

                              The incidence rate of Alpha Thalassemia is about 1 in 100,000 people in North America. There is 
                              estimated to be around 1,200 transfusion dependent patients in the US. The occurrence of Alpha 
                              Thalassemia is in Mediterranean regions of Southern Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa. It is 
                              also seen in people from India and Asia.

                              Hemoglobin in Red Blood cells is made up of 2 alpha proteins and 2 beta proteins. The Thalassemia 
                              stems from mutations in the genes that make up the alpha or beta proteins. You get 2 copies of the Alpha 
                              gene from Mom and 2 from Dad for a total of 4. The mutations that occur in the alpha gene locus are 
                              deletion mutations. This results in the complete loss of 1 to all 4 of the genes for the alpha proteins.
                              The loss of 1 gene is represented like (aa/a-). This leads to the Alpha Thalassemia trait. These 
                              patients will be otherwise completely normal. They have the ability to pass that trait to their 
                              children in an autosomal recessive fashion. Alpha Thalassemia Minor comes from the loss of 2 of the 4 
                              genes. This can be both from the same parent or one from each parent. This is represented by (a-/a-) or 
                              (aa/--). This leads to a mild microcytic anemia, but these patients are otherwise very healthy. The loss of 
                              3 of the 4 genes leads to Alpha Thalassemia Major or Hemoglobin H (HbH) disease. This is named such because 
                              the alpha protein levels will be so low the Hemoglobin will start forming with 4 beta proteins. This is 
                              represented as (a-/--). 
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              These patients will have severe anemia with other symptoms. They will have a low 
                              Hematocrit and Hemoglobin showing Anemia. They will have a low MCV showing microcytic. They will have an 
                              enlarged spleen due to extravascular hemolysis. They will have signs of hemolysis with elevated Bilirubin 
                              and LDH levels. The Red Blood cells they make will be misshaped. They will be destroyed in the Spleen 
                              nearly as fast as they are made.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The treatment for Alpha Thalassemia Major is frequent blood transfusion. Each time blood is given, all 
                              those red blood cells bring with them more iron. This leads to iron overload. Then they need chelation 
                              therapy to remove the iron.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The last form of Alpha Thalassemia is the loss of all 4 alpha genes. This is referred to as Bart's Disease. 
                              This leads to spontaneous loss of the fetus. If you recall back to our previous sections, we said that an embryo 
                              made HbE until it because a fetus which started producing Fetal Hb (HbF). Fetal Hemoglobin requires alpha 
                              chains of which there will be none with the loss of all 4 genes.  This results in Hydrops Fetalis which is the loss 
                              of the fetus.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="betathal">Beta Thalassemia</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Like with Alpha Thalassemia, Beta Thalassemia is very prominent in the Mediterranean area with 
                              Southern Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa. Its also in Asia at a lower rate. It has the same rate 
                              of incidence as Alpha Thalassemia at 1 per 100,000 people in the population. It is estimated that about 
                              1,300 people in the US have Beta Thalassemia. This form of Thalassemia will present around 6 months of age 
                              as the baby goes from making Fetal Hb which has Gamma globins to making Adult Hb which uses the Beta 
                              Globins.
                         </p>
                         <p>     
                              Hemoglobin in Red Blood cells is made up of 2 alpha proteins and 2 beta proteins. The Thalassemia 
                              disease stems from mutations in the genes that make up the alpha or beta proteins. You get just 1 copy 
                              of the Beta Globin gene from each parent. The defects in this gene are single point mutations. This means 
                              just a single base has been changed. There are many different mutations, but they are usually in the 
                              promoter region or the splicing regions. This results in one of two possible outcomes for the Beta Protein. 
                              You can either end up with a protein that is partially functional or one that is completely non functional. 
                              That leaves the Beta gene with 3 possible states. The first is the fully functional normal gene represented 
                              at Beta (B). The second is the partially functional gene which is represented Beta Plus (B+). 
                              The third is the non functional gene which is represented as Beta Zero (B0).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This leaves us with 3 forms of Beta Thalassemia. The first is Beta Thalassemia Minor. This is where at least 
                              1 of the 2 genes is fully functional represented as (B/B0) or (B/B+). This means one gene makes fully 
                              functional Beta globin proteins. These patients are typically mild in their anemia and symptoms. Patients 
                              with at least 1 partially functional gene will fall into Beta Thalassemia Intermedia. They will have 
                              moderate anemia and need some transfusions. This is represented by the possibilities of (B+/B+) or (B+/B0). 
                              The final category is the Beta Thalassemia Major patients. They have no functional copies of the Beta 
                              globin gene. They are (B0/B0). They will have severe anemia and life long transfusions.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This will be a microcytic anemia which has low Hematocrit and low Hemoglobin levels and low MCV.
                              Beta Thalassemia patients will often have a higher than normal Red Blood cell count like 6 million 
                              or more per micro liter. This is thought to occur as the body is producing huge amounts of RBCs to try 
                              to keep up. Without any functional Beta Globin, these RBCs will make Hemoglobin out of 4 alpha chains 
                              which will be unstable. These RBCs won't live very long. Any of the bad non functional Beta globin 
                              chains will still be in the RBCs and precipitate in the cells. This will cause the Spleen Macrophages 
                              to destroy these RBCs. This will lead to and enlarged spleen and Hemolytic anemia with high LDH and 
                              Bilirubin levels.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              With Beta Thalassemia you can also see bone abnormalities as the bones around the skull and face grow 
                              larger bone marrow capacity to attempt to make more Red Blood Cells. You can also see what is called extramedullary 
                              hematopoiesis. This is where the stem cells that make all the cells of the blood spread out into the organs 
                              like the Spleen and Liver to start producing new Red Blood cells in those organs. This contributes to enlargement 
                              of both the spleen and liver. The only treatment for Beta Thalassemia is blood transfusions which brings 
                              with it the iron overload and the need for chelation therapy.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The same gene editing therapy they are using in Sickle Cell Disease is also being developed for Beta 
                              Thalassemia. They extract the stem cells from the patient and edit them to switch them back to making Fetal 
                              Hemoglobin. They will use Busulfan myeloablation therapy to wipe out the bad stem cells. Then they administer
                              the edited stem cells which will make Fetal Hemoglobin. The data shows this is a functional cure for this disease.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="aiha">Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia</h2>
                         <p> 
                              Up until now we studied all the intrinsic defects of Red Blood cell. These all focused on something being 
                              wrong with the Red Blood cell itself like structural proteins, iron deficiency or defects in Hemoglobin 
                              formation. Now we are going to start looking at the extrinsic factors that can target and kill Red Blood Cells. 
                              This can be things like drugs that attach to Red Blood cells and cause antibody formation toward those 
                              drugs. This is the case in some forms of Penicillin reactions.  Here the Penicillin binds to the RBC and then 
                              the immune system creates antibodies toward this new foreign substance that is bound to the RBC. Then the 
                              immune system kills the RBC as if it were a pathogen. This is the rare case of drug induced hemolytic 
                              anemia.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The most common case of Autoimmune driven anemia is acquired. This means it can happen to anyone at any time. 
                              This comes from antibodies being formed toward a pathogen suddenly binds to proteins on the surface of 
                              the Red Blood cells. To understand this, I have to dive a bit into immunology, antibodies and Epitopes. I 
                              had covered this concept in my T cells thread. There are thousands of proteins made within the body. Even 
                              pathogens are made up of proteins. All these proteins are made up of amino acids. A protein is just a long 
                              string of amino acids folded into a 3 dimensional shape. The receptors of Antibodies and T cells will 
                              recognize a specific sequence of amino acids. For antibodies, its 13 to 25 amino acids in size. Each Antibody 
                              only recognizes a specific sequence of amino acids of the much larger protein. Since proteins can be 
                              hundreds or even thousands of amino acids in length, there is a potential of antibodies to be made toward 
                              many parts of the protein. This could be a pathogen protein like a bacteria cell wall, or it could be the
                              protein on one of our cells like CD19. Each antibody only recognizes a specific piece of that protein 
                              called the epitope. This leads us to the idea of a collision in the epitope of a protein with something bad 
                              like a bacteria and something good like a protein on the surface of a Red Blood Cell. There are only 20 amino 
                              acids and tens of thousands of proteins. The odds of 2 proteins having the same epitope for an antibody is 
                              bound to exist. This means the antibody you made for the flu last year might share and epitope with a 
                              protein on your RBCs.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Guillain barre syndrome is another autoimmune disorder that can appear shortly after a new infection as 
                              antibodies created start to attack nerve cells. This can also occur in cancer where antibodies toward the 
                              tumor will attack healthy tissues. This is called Paraneoplatic syndrome. So the odds of an antibody created 
                              toward a pathogen can have an epitope that matches something friendly. In Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemias 
                              (AIHA), you get antibodies for proteins on the Red Blood Cell. This means those antibodies will bind to 
                              the RBC and drive an immune response either by complement or by spleen macrophages. This leads to a 
                              destruction anemia as Red Blood cells are destroyed.
