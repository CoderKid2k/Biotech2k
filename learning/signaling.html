                         Cell replication is a highly controlled process and uncontrolled cell replication leads to 
                         cancer. Some cells replicate often while others never do. The type of cell determines when 
                         and how often it replicates. Some cells like GI tract and immune cells replicate often. They 
                         have a very high turnover rate. Many cells only replicate when necessary. This happens when 
                         their is damage or injury that destroys those cells. Then new cells are created to replace the 
                         missing cells. 
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                         The basis of the process is one cell creates a growth factor in response to 
                         injury or an event. The growth factor binds to the growth receptor on another cell which then begins
                         the process of replication.
                         The growth receptor is the first place where genetic mutations can cause cancer. The receptors 
                         are proteins that are encoded in the DNA. Mutations in that protein receptor can alter its 
                         function. Some mutations lead to an always on effect of the growth receptor. This means the 
                         receptor no longer needs the growth factor to become active. Other mutations lead to many copies 
                         of the growth receptor. This causes over stimulation of the cell to replicate. Every cell has a 
                         growth factor receptor, but not every cell has the same growth factor receptor. 
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                         Growth receptors 
                         come in families. These families will be used in different tissues. That way a growth signal from 
                         one tissue doesn't stimulate growth in another tissue. Some tissues will share some of the same growth 
                         receptor families. This is why you will see them in specific types of cancer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                         The first major 
                         growth receptor is the EGFR family which plays a major role in lung cancer and a smaller role 
                         in other cancers like glioma or Head & Neck cancer. EGFR stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. 
                         It is also known as Erb or HER (Human Epidermal Growth Receptor). These 3 names are used 
                         interchangeably. In lung cancer EGFR makes up about 10% to 15% of the mutations. There are 4 isoforms 
                         of EGFR which are EGFR 1-4 or HER 1-4. When in lung cancer, we call it EGFR. In breast cancer HER2 
                         makes up about 15% to 20% of breast cancer. There are 2 very common mutations in EGFR lung cancer 
                         to help develop understanding of how mutations in the receptor can cause cancer. The first is the 
                         Exon 19 deletion EGFR cancers. They make up about 47% of the EGFR mutations in lung cancer. The other 
                         major mutation is the Exon 21 L858R substitution mutation. There is another 12% that makes up many 
                         other smaller mutations. There are drugs developed to target the blocking of the EGFR receptor.
                         This helps stop the aberrant signaling that drives cancer. Often treatment with a drug targeting 
                         these mutations leads to new mutations which get around the inhibition of the drug. For example, 
                         EGFR inhibitors often lead to T797M mutations. This leads to resistance. 
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                         Next up is VEGFR which 
                         stands for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor. There are 4 isoform so this from VEGFR 1-4. 
                         They have different roles in different areas of the vasculature. VEGFR inhibitors have a role in wet 
                         AMD to block new blood vessel formation. Its been used in oncology to block new blood vessel formation 
                         that helps cancer grow. 
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                         Another growth factor receptor is FGFR. It stand for Fibroblast Growth 
                         Factor Receptor. This one comes with a high level of toxicity as it affects things like the skin. 
                         There are some FGFR inhibitors out there, but they tend to have high toxicity. I know Relay is working 
                         on a FGFR2 inhibitor that is designed with low toxicity developed using AI and ML. This is in clinical 
                         development for Cholangiocarcinoma and some other FGFR mutant cancers.
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                         Another important growth receptor 
                         is the PDGFR. This stands for Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor. This has a role GI cancers.
                         These are some of the major growth factor receptors that can mutate and cause cancer in various tissues.
                         There are some smaller ones like MET, KIT, ROS1 and ALK. These tend to play a role in some cancers 
                         like MET in Kidney cancer. KIT plays a role in Systemic Mastocytosis and Blueprint is working on drugs
                         for this proliferation disorder of mast cells. ROS1 and ALK play a role in lung cancer for growth receptors.
                         Another small one is NTRK which is a growth receptor in Neurological cancers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                         Some of the mutations in these 
                         growth receptors are single base substitutions. Others are amplifications where the gene is copied many 
                         times. Others are rearrangements of the gene. Some are fusions of two genes. There are many ways these 
                         receptors can mutate that lead to over activation of the growth pathways. Blocking that signaling can 
                         help fight these cancers. Next we will look at the 2 major growth pathways these growth receptors 
                         activate no matter which cell the receptor belongs to. There are many growth receptors, but a few key 
                         pathways they activate.
