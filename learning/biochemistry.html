                         <p>     
                              The first building block of life is called carbohydrates or sugars. You might also hear them called 
                              glycans. They are made up of carbon structures with a single oxygen binding the carbons into a 
                              ring-like structure. Usually, each carbon has a hydroxyl (OH) group on it. They can come in 
                              different carbon numbers. Ribose makes up RNA and DNA and it has 5 carbons; whereas, glucose, 
                              fructose and galactose are made up of 6 carbons bound into a ring-like structure. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A monosaccharide is the most basic structure of carbohydrates as it is just one single carbohydrate. 
                              There are several monosaccharides we will deal with in biology. They are Glucose, Galactose and 
                              Fructose.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              RNA and DNA are made up of a monosaccharide called Ribose. The only difference between these two 
                              molecules is the number 2 carbon has a single hydrogen instead of the OH group in DNA. This is why 
                              it is called deoxyribose. Deoxy means one less oxygen. The entire DNA structure is made up of 
                              nucleotides built of nucleic acids attached to deoxyribose sugars. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All RNA is made up of ribose sugars. The key attribute of the extra oxygen on the number 2 carbon 
                              for RNA is that it prevents the RNA from wanting to become double stranded like DNA. It causes an 
                              electrical force that wants to repel double stranding. This is one of the main reasons DNA can be 
                              double stranded and RNA will be single stranded. That single missing oxygen allows DNA to bind in 
                              double strands without causing electrical resistance between the atoms.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The carbohydrates we ingest for nutrition come from three basic monosaccharides with glucose, 
                              fructose and galactose. These three carbohydrates have the exact same chemical formula of C6H12O6. 
                              They are isomers of each other as their atoms are slightly arranged in different configurations. The 
                              main difference due to their differences in structure is their different level of sweetness. Glucose 
                              is sweeter than Galactose and Fructose is sweeter than glucose. Many of these sugars come together to 
                              form Disaccharide compounds. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Disaccharides are compounds made up of two monosaccharides. There are some basic formations you will 
                              find with Sucrose, Lactose and Maltose. Sucrose is what we call table sugar, and it's made up of one 
                              glucose bound to one fructose. Lactose is made up of one Glucose bound to one Galactose. Maltose is 
                              made up of two glucose bound together. These are the basic disaccharides. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There is an enzyme in the digestive tract called Lactase which is designed to break the bond between 
                              the Glucose and Galactose in the Lactose disaccharide found in milk. People who lack this enzyme can 
                              not break that bond and can not digest lactose. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A polysaccharide is made up of long chains of monosaccharides which we call starch and cellulose. 
                              This is one of the main rigid building blocks in plant structures that gives them form. The 
                              difference between starch and cellulose is the bonding patterns between the two. Cellulose is also 
                              called fiber, and fiber is not digestible which makes it very important for digestive health. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              You will often hear the term simple carbs and complex carbs. The simple carbs are the monosaccharides 
                              and disaccharides. They break down quickly and get into the bloodstream quickly to drive up the sugar 
                              levels. The complex carbs are the starch and fiber. The starch takes much longer to break down which 
                              allows the sugar to slowly digest into the bloodstream over time.  
                         </p>
