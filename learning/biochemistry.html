                         <p>     
                              The first building block of life is called carbohydrates or sugars. You might also hear them called 
                              glycans. They are made up of a carbon chain with a single oxygen binding the carbons into a 
                              ring-like structure that looks like a stop sign. Usually, each carbon has a hydroxyl (OH) group on it. They can come in 
                              different carbon numbers. Ribose makes up RNA and DNA and it has 5 carbons; whereas, glucose, 
                              fructose and galactose are made up of 6 carbons bound into a ring-like structure. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A monosaccharide is the most basic structure of carbohydrates as it is just one single carbohydrate. 
                              There are several monosaccharides we will deal with in biology. They are Glucose, Galactose and 
                              Fructose.
                              RNA and DNA are made up of a 5 carbon monosaccharide called Ribose. The only difference between RNA and DNA 
                              is the number 2 carbon has a single hydrogen for DNA instead of the OH group. This is why 
                              it is called deoxyribose. Deoxy means one less oxygen. The entire DNA structure is made up of 
                              nucleotides built of nucleic acids attached to deoxyribose sugars. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              All RNA is made up of ribose sugars. The key attribute of the extra oxygen on the number 2 carbon 
                              for RNA is that it prevents the RNA from wanting to become double stranded like DNA. It causes an 
                              electrical force that wants to repel double stranding. This is one of the main reasons DNA can be 
                              double stranded and RNA will be single stranded. That single missing oxygen allows DNA to bind in 
                              double strands without causing electrical resistance between the atoms.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The carbohydrates we ingest for nutrition come from three basic monosaccharides with glucose, 
                              fructose and galactose. These three carbohydrates have the exact same chemical formula of C6H12O6. 
                              They are isomers of each other as their atoms are slightly arranged in different configurations. The 
                              main difference due to their differences in structure is their different level of sweetness. Glucose 
                              is sweeter than Galactose and Fructose is sweeter than glucose. Many of these sugars come together to 
                              form Disaccharide compounds. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Disaccharides are compounds made up of two monosaccharides. There are some basic formations you will 
                              find with Sucrose, Lactose and Maltose. Sucrose is what we call table sugar, and it's made up of one 
                              glucose bound to one fructose. Lactose is made up of one Glucose bound to one Galactose. Maltose is 
                              made up of two glucose bound together. These are the basic disaccharides. 
                              There is an enzyme in the digestive tract called Lactase which is designed to break the bond between 
                              the Glucose and Galactose in the Lactose disaccharide found in milk. People who lack this enzyme can 
                              not break that bond and can not digest lactose. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              A polysaccharide is made up of long chains of monosaccharides which we call starch and cellulose. 
                              This is one of the main rigid building blocks in plant structures that gives them form. The 
                              difference between starch and cellulose is the bonding patterns between the two. Cellulose is also 
                              called fiber, and fiber is not digestible which makes it very important for digestive health. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              You will often hear the term simple carbs and complex carbs. The simple carbs are the monosaccharides 
                              and disaccharides. They break down quickly and get into the bloodstream quickly to drive up the sugar 
                              levels. The complex carbs are the starch and fiber. The starch takes much longer to break down which 
                              allows the sugar to slowly digest into the bloodstream over time.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="lipids">Lipids</h2>
                         <p>
                              Lipids are hydrocarbons and they make up oils, fats and waxes. They have a good role in biology, but 
                              they can also have a bad role in biology. Some fats do not help while others are essential. We call 
                              them essential fatty acids. The key to a fatty acid is the Carboxylic Acid group on the end of the 
                              long chain hydrocarbon. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Fatty acids come in a few different kinds. The first is saturated fats. With saturated fat, there 
                              are no double bonds in the carbon chain. Saturated fats are the bad fats. They are fully saturated with hydrogens. The second is the 
                              unsaturated fat. This has at least one double bond in the carbon chain. Unsaturated fats come from plants, 
                              oils, nuts and seeds. They are called the good fats. A polyunsaturated fat has 
                              more than one double bond. All essential fats are polyunsaturated.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Most saturated fats are bad and come from meats while unsaturated fats come from mostly plants. 
                              Trans fat is really bad as they are artificially made. If you remember the concept of a trans 
                              configuration around a double bond, they have the functional groups on the opposite sides of the 
                              double bonded carbons. They are very bad as the human body does not process them correctly.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The Glycerol element is a 3-carbon structure that is used to bind 3 fatty acids to it. It's a form 
                              of fat storage. When we consume too much fat, they will get bound to the glycerol to form a 
                              triglyceride which stores that extra fat. The build up and storage of bad fats using triglycerides leads 
                              to cardiovascular disease.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              So far we only focused on the consumption and storage of fatty acids, but we will now look at the 
                              use of these fatty acids that make them beneficial. The most important role of fatty acids is to 
                              make up phospholipids. 
                              The phospholipid takes the Glycerol element and binds 2 fatty acids to it, one being a saturated fat 
                              and the other being an unsaturated fat. The third carbon then binds to a phosphate group creating a 
                              compound that has phosphate at one end and the tails of the 2 fatty acids at the other end. This 
                              makes the phosphate head hydrophilic (water loving). The fatty acid end will be hydrophobic (water 
                              hating).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              These phospholipids work together to make the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membranes. The cell
                               membrane takes two rows of phospholipids and places them with the phosphates away from each other
                               and the fatty acid ends toward each other. This allows the cell to separate the water outside the 
                               cell from the water inside the cell. This phospholipid bilayer will be one of the most critical 
                               concepts of biology.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              When a phospholipid gets damaged, some of the fatty acids will be dislodged by the trauma. There is 
                              an enzyme called phospholipase A2. This will trigger a pathway called Arachidonic Acid which plays a 
                              key role in tissue inflammation and blood clotting.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              There are 5 basic nucleic acids that make up human DNA and RNA. They are synthesized from 
                              reactions in the cells. The 5 nucleic acids are Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine and Uracil. 
                              They are made up of nitrogen-based structures and are often called the nitrogen bases. They get 
                              attached to a ribose sugar and a phosphate group to form what is called a nucleotide. These 
                              nucleotides get chained together to form strands of DNA or RNA.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The 4 nucleic acids used in DNA are Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine. Thymine is replaced 
                              with Uracil in the RNA. The only difference between the actual nucleic acids is the Thymine and 
                              Uracil. The other difference is the ribose vs deoxyribose we looked at earlier.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The nucleic acids are synthesized from pathways and enzymes to create the bases that make up the 
                              nucleic acids. They are made from the process of purine and pyrimidine synthesis. There are 
                              disorders of the process of synthesis of making nucleic acids. There is also a disorder for 
                              people who don't break down the nucleic acids correctly. One such example is gout, which is the 
                              failure of the body to remove the Uric Acid created by the breakdown of purine nucleic acids. 
                              This allows the uric acid to build up in the joints and cause inflammation and damage.

                              There are 20 basic amino acids. They make up all proteins and all life on earth. The basic 
                              structure for amino acids is the same. They have an alpha carbon which is attached to a 
                              carboxylic acid group, an amino group and a side group that changes with each amino acid. The 
                              only difference between the amino acids is their side group. 
                         </p>     
                         <p>
                              The side group is critical and it makes up the basic chemical attributes of that amino acid. 
                              Some of them are non polar meaning they won't like water. They will be hydrophobic which is 
                              water hating. Some amino acids will be polar which makes them hydrophilic which is water loving. 
                              A few will have neither a positive or negative charge. Understanding these attributes of amino 
                              acids will be very important later when we get into the building of proteins and their folding.

                         <p>
                              We ingest amino acids in the form of the protein that we eat. All proteins are made up of long 
                              chains of amino acids. Our cells will take in the fragments of proteins we ingest and break 
                              them down. The process of the cell breaking down the protein into its basic amino acids is called 
                              catabolism. This is done inside a cellular organelle called the lysosome. Inside the lysosome are 
                              enzymes that will break down the proteins into amino acids. The cell will then take those amino acids 
                              and use them as building blocks to make new proteins. There is also another cellular process by which 
                              the cell can recycle proteins it creates to break them down into amino acids and recycle them for use. 
                              This is called autophagy. This occurs during cellular stress like starvation. This causes the cell to break 
                              down and recycle unused proteins to get the amino acids to build new necessary proteins. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Some of the amino acids our cells need can be synthesized by the body. The amino acids we can't make 
                              ourselves require us to eat food to get them. These are called essential amino acids. After the cell 
                              has broken down the proteins into amino acids, it can use them to make new proteins that it needs. This 
                              is done by the cellular organelle called the ribosome. These ribosomes work very much like a factory 
                              for building proteins. They receive a messenger RNA that is the blueprint for that protein. They read 
                              that blueprint and use it to take amino acids and chain them together into a long chain called a 
                              peptide.
                         </p>     
                         <p>
                              After the peptide chain is constructed, it will fold into a 3 dimensional structure of the protein. It 
                              uses those many hydrophilic, hydrophobic and electrical forces of the amino acids to fold itself. All 
                              the hydrophobic amino acids will fold inward away from the water inside the cell. The hydrophobic amino 
                              acids will fold outward toward the water as they like the water. The electrical forces will create 
                              bonds between specific amino acids to hold everything together.
                         </p>     
                         <p>
                              The structure of a protein determines its function. If even a single amino acid is coded wrong, it can 
                              dramatically change the structure of the protein and thus its function. That is exactly what happens in 
                              the rare genetic disease Sickle Cell Anemia. A single mutation in the DNA codes the wrong amino acid, 
                              turning it from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. This changes the entire behavior of that new protein 
                              leading to disease.

                              An enzyme is a protein that facilitates a chemical reaction. All enzymes end in -ase so you will 
                              quickly recognize them by their names. A good example is Lactase which is an enzyme that helps break 
                              apart Lactose. Many chemical processes in biology can be very slow. An enzyme can lower the energy 
                              necessary to start a reaction or it can speed up the time it takes. Some enzymes can facilitate a 
                              chemical reaction many fold.

                         <h2 class="science-headers" id="respiration">Cellular Respiration</h2>
                         <p>
                              Cellular respiration comes in 3 steps: Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and Electron Transport Chain. The 
                              entire goal of this process is to break down glucose and produce energy in the form of Adenosine 
                              Triphosphate (ATP). It produces on average about 38 ATP from a single glucose.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Adenosine Triphosphate is the energy currency of the cells. It's made up of an adenine nucleic acid 
                              just like that which is used in DNA or RNA. It even includes the ribose and the phosphate group. 
                              That is the basic structure of the Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP). Then you add on two more 
                              phosphate groups. Each phosphate that is added requires an input of energy to attach the 
                              phosphate group. This becomes a medium of energy storage. By releasing a phosphate, the energy 
                              stored in the molecule can be released. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The adenosine can have between 1 and 3 phosphate groups. The most energetic is the Adenosine Triphosphate
                              (ATP). Once the first phosphate group is removed, it becomes adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This 
                              then can become energy for other cellular processes. The ADP is used in activation of platelets.
                              Once the second phosphate is removed, it becomes adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The AMP acts as a 
                              low energy sensor for the cell.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              There are different kinds of energy used in the cells. This means the cells need a method to 
                              exchange one type of energy currency for another. Just like you go to the bank to exchange dollars 
                              to euros, the cell can exchange one form of energy for another. There are different enzymes in the 
                              cells that are responsible for conversion of the energy from one form to another.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                               The other form of energy in the cell uses a guanine in place of the adenine. This makes Guanosine 
                               Triphosphate. Again, this can exist in three forms with 1 to 3 phosphates attached to the guanine. 
                               There are processes in the cell by which guanine is used. Different processes in the cell will 
                               cost different types of energy. Those processes in the cell that use the Guanine form of energy 
                               are called the Second Messengers. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Glycolysis is the first step of cellular respiration. It occurs in the cell cytoplasm. It requires no 
                              oxygen to conduct the process of glycolysis. This is called an anaerobic process as it takes no oxygen. 
                              Glycolysis uses a series of enzymes to break sugar in half from glucose, fructose or galactose C6H12O3 
                              into pyruvate (C3H3O3). We could spend a ton of time going over all these enzymes, but you really only 
                              need to know the process and not every enzyme or step in the process. There are genetic disorders where 
                              one of these enzymes does not get made. One such disorder is Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency. This is 
                              missing that very last pyruvate kinase enzyme which makes the pyruvate. The process of glycolysis 
                              costs 2 ATP as an input energy to get the process working. As the glucose is broken down by enzymes, 
                              it makes 4 ATP, 2 NADH and 2 pyruvate molecules (C3H3O3). The NAD is an enzyme which is responsible 
                              for transporting hydrogen ions. This will be important later in the Electron Transport Chain.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This process of glycolysis is used by Red Blood Cells (RBCs) so as not to use oxygen. The RBC is built 
                              to bind and deliver oxygen to the tissues of the body. It only makes sense that these cells would not 
                              consume oxygen in the process of their delivery. They still need energy so they use just basic 
                              glycolysis to get that energy. RBCs will only do glycolysis and skip the rest of the cellular 
                              respiration cycle.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              If there is oxygen, the pyruvate goes into Krebs cycle to be broken down further. If there is a lack of 
                              oxygen, then the pyruvate will ferment into lactic acid. Lactic acid is what makes your muscles hurt 
                              when you work out. This is caused by the deprivation of oxygen to the muscle during an intense workout 
                              which causes the pyruvate to ferment into lactic acid. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Cancer cells will use glycolysis to live in low oxygen tissues where there is no oxygen. The 
                              reprogramming of cellular respiration is one of the hallmarks of cancer. This causes lactic acid to be 
                              a byproduct of the cancer cells. Many cancer cells will then ramp up the level of their glucose intake 
                              so they can make all the needed energy using basic glycolysis. This allows us to use the high glucose 
                              intake of cancer cells to develop a scan that can detect this using glucose tagged with an isotope. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              After the pyruvate has been created by glycolysis, the pyruvate and NADH will travel into the 
                              mitochondria which is the powerhouse of the cell. The process of the Kreb cycle will require oxygen. 
                              This happens inside the inner part of the mitochondria. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              First the pyruvate is modified to become acetyl Coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) before it undergoes breakdown 
                              into hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide (CO2). Once the acetyl CoA is created, it will be broken down by 
                              the use of 2 ATP. This process will create 2 ATP along with 6 more NADH and 2 FAD(H2). The FAD enzyme 
                              is another enzyme that binds and transports hydrogen ions.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              At this point, the glucose has fully been broken down and all the carbons, and oxygens have been 
                              released as CO2. The hydrogens are all now bound in the form of NADH and FAD(H2). These hydrogen 
                              ions will then go on into the Electron Transport Chain.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              The mitochondria has an inner chamber where the Kreb cycle happens. Then there is an inner membrane 
                              that separates the inner mitochondria from the outer mitochondria. Inside this inner membrane are 
                              these little hydrogen ion pumps. The NADH and FAD(H2) will transfer their hydrogens through these 
                              pumps. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              As all the hydrogens are transferred out of the inner mitochondria to the outer part, the gradient 
                              of hydrogen ions increases. Once a specific level of hydrogen concentration is reached in the outer 
                              mitochondria, it will cause these special enzymes called ATP synthase to open up and release the 
                              hydrogen ions back across the membrane into the inner mitochondria again. This requires oxygen and 
                              combines the hydrogens to the oxygen creating water. 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              This process causes the ATP synthase to become active. It works much like a water wheel. As the 
                              hydrogens move through the ATP synthase, they will spin a small gear-like structure. This creates 
                              the energy from the releasing of all the hydrogen ions across the membrane. It uses this energy to 
                              take the phosphates and put them back onto ADP to make new ATP. This process varies based on the 
                              amount of hydrogen gradient between the inner and outer mitochondria. The average is around 32 ATP 
                              is made by the ATP synthase. This makes up the bulk of all the ATP created during cellular 
                              respiration. This is where the mitochondria gets its nickname as the power plant of the cell.
