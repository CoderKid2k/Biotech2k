                    <h2 class="section-title" id="tomorrowinnovation">You Can Have The Future of Tomorrow Today</h2>
                    <p>
                         I have heard many people try to call this crash in biotech the end of the Biotechnology sector. 
                         A sector that has been around for decades. One of the most necessary sectors in the entire 
                         market. Here I am going to lay out for you the opposite case. I have been investing in tech and 
                         biotech for 27 years. I have seen so much technology that excites me about the future, and I see 
                         it today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The biggest question I always get in biotech investing is when will we run out of things to 
                         discover or great new technologies to invent. I my response is we will never run out until we cure 
                         every disease. We are entering a very exciting new era in biotechnology where we have new tools that 
                         could completely redefine the future. People who listen to those naysayers could be missing the best 
                         opportunity of their lifetimes. I actually have more excitement and investment ideas today than I ever 
                         had in my 27 years of investing. New technologies like using AI or Machine Learning to make new 
                         connections in biology or genetics could revolutionize how we approach drug discovery. Automation can 
                         reduce workloads and simplify redundant processes to bring down costs of drug discovery. We have come to 
                         call this space of biotech the #TechBio space. This is just beginning to get started. Right now everyone 
                         is skeptical of this space. I think in 10 years, any company that did not embrace these technologies 
                         will fade away into the history books of time. There are going to be new leaders in this space that 
                         emerge to become tomorrow's Google or Amazon. We can find them today for a mere fraction of what they 
                         could be tomorrow. Most of these companies are selling near their levels of cash. The discovery of new 
                         technology will always get funding by the visionary few. The next space of excitement is Gene Editing 
                         tools like CRISPR. These tools are in their infancy and will continue to evolve as bright mind continue 
                         to find new ways to use them to do editing safer and easier. Barriers like delivery will be broken 
                         and there will be a revolution in fixing and removing Genetic Diseases from the human race. The 
                         companies that succeed here will be worth fortunes. The power of gene editing has given birth to Synthetic
                         Biology. This is the ability to take gene editing tools and use it to reprogram microbes to make them 
                         beneficial. We can reprogram pathogens to produce fertilizer or scrub carbon from the environment. The 
                         future ability of scientist to rewrite life on earth using gene editing can be exciting and terribly 
                         frighting. It is an awesome power and responsibility. There is going to be a need for Biosecurity to 
                         protect use from the ability of bad actors to misuse this technology.  Rewriting life won't just stop 
                         with microbes. We can use it to create human cells from stem cells. We have technologies like Induced 
                         Pluripotent Stem cells called iPSC that can allow us to reprogram human cells. We can create cell therapies 
                         to fight cancer already today. This is just getting started as we learn more about cell biology and 
                         human biology. I believe someday we will be able to grow entire organs from a single cell donation. The 
                         last area will be the revolution of Sequencing. This has been a space of rapid evolution. We are still 
                         far from the ability to do end to end sequencing on every genome on earth for a very low cost. Someday, we 
                         will get our genome sequenced and we will know everything about ourselves. The risk and the benefits. We 
                         will be able to tailor medicine to the individual. Personalized medicine is only just beginning with 
                         cancer therapies. Someday we will know our risk long before it even becomes a disease. We will be focused 
                         more on prevention and correction before the disease occurs. Combining sequencing with other therapies 
                         like gene editing could allow sickness to be corrected before it happens. While many have taken to writing 
                         article predicting the end of biotechnology, I have taken to the spreading of the Science Of The Future. 
                         I think scary sells a lot of articles, but vision will favor the investor.
