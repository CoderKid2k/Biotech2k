                    <p class="large-text">Investing in biotechnology companies can be very hard. There is a
                       very high level of failure in this industry. There are many complicated concepts that 
                       make it hard to understand. This can be very intimidating for many investors. This site
                       is designed to be a source of education and information for investors. It is not 
                       designed to be financial advice. If you find interest in any of the companies here, 
                       you should consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. 
                       This is a very risky area of investing. It is not for everyone, and there is a high level
                       of risk as many of these companies fail.

                    <p class="large-text">
                       The first section is about the discovery and the tracking of
                       science in the biotechnology industry that is leading the innovation of the future.
                       We will look at what technologies in the science appear to be leading the way forward.
                       These will be just my opinions and ideas. Your opinions might be different. That is OK.
                       There is a lot of great science
                       going on in this industry. Some of it will appeal more to one investor than another. 
                       It is all about personal opinion. The innovation section will be designed to give ideas for
                       investors as a jumping off point. Not all areas of innovation will work out. Sometimes great
                       science still fails. Sometimes it runs into obstacles or just doesn't live up to expectations.
                       The innovation section will change as science evolves. There will always be science that
                       matures while new science is discovered. This section will always be about "what's next"?

                    </h2>

                    <p class="large-text">
                         The next section of the site will be about all the companies behind the areas of
                         innovation that are driving biotechnology forward. These are the companies that could
                         be the next big breakthrough. Many will fail. The failure rate in biotechnology is over
                         90%. That means the vast majority of these companies can and probably will fail. I
                         think that is what appeals to many investors about biotechnology. It is the treasure hunt
                         of finding the next big breakthrough company. I will cover the companies. I will talk
                         about the management, the financials, the science, the quality of the data, and propose
                         my best guess at valuation. This section will be the most opinionated part of the website.
                         This will be my thoughts and impressions based on my experience in investing in these
                         companies. I will also disclose that I will personally be invested in many of these companies.
                         You should always do your own research into any company and consult a professional financial
                         advisor before making any investment.

                    <p class="large-text">
                         The next section of the site will be about the science behind the companies. I tend to focus on
                         a few key science themes with Genetics, Hematology, Immunology and Oncology. They tend to be 
                         very complementary with each other when it comes to diseases. I tend to focus on the use of
                         technology in drug discovery, genetic diseases and oncology. I find having a focus on a few key topics
                         offers expertise and helps me improve my success rates. I love teaching others about science.
                         This section will include everything educational about topics like Hematology, 
                         Immunology, Genetics and Oncology. This is a learning resource. It is not necessary to know the science
                         to be a biotechnology investor, but it really helps. I find that scientists, doctors, students
                         and patients tend to like this section the most. Just a word of caution as this is not designed
                         to be medical advice. You should always refer to your doctor.

                    <p class="large-text">
                         The last section will be about breaking down the clinical data. I think the hardest part
                         of being a biotechnology investor is knowing how to read the clinical data, and how to figure out 
                         what it all means. There are a lot of technical endpoints that can confuse investors. Sometimes
                         companies fail to design a good clinical trial. This happens too often. Many of these young companies
                         are not experts in designing or running clinical trials. This section will be some teaching about 
                         the clinical trials and the data to look for, but a lot of it will be going through actual clinical 
                         data readouts by companies and breaking it down. I am not an expert in reading clinical data, but I 
                         have been doing it for many years. Most of the takes I give on clinical data will be just my point
                         of view. Other investors might not agree with my point of view on any data readouts. That is OK. There
                         is a lot to consider when looking at data to include data from competitors.
